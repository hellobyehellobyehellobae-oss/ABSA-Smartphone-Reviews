1,0,"Worst mobile i have bought ever, Battery is draining like hell, backup is only 6 to 7 hours with internet uses, even if I put mobile idle its getting discharged.This is biggest lie from Amazon & Lenove which is not at all expected, they are making full by saying that battery is 4000MAH & booster charger is fake, it takes at least 4 to 5 hours to be fully charged.Don't know how Lenovo will survive by making full of us.Please don;t go for this else you will regret like me."

136,1,The product is awesome
137,1,Great phone
138,0,Hang hota Hai phone
139,0,Great phone with excellent connectivity. Quick charging and excellent talk time due to the large battery. The twin camera requires steadier hands than mine. OTA update to Android 8.0. But the Bluetooth connection on this phone is intermittent and unstable.Supplementary information: The claimed gorilla glass 3 screen is probably ordinary glass as it cracked as the phone slipped from my grasp while sitting on a sofa. Lenovo says the screen is not covered. Reducing rating to two stars.
140,1,"Fast delivery. Delivery is to be provided for all districts. Good phone. Feels a bit heavy. Notification sounds can't be adjusted, is a bit annoying. Photos takes a lot more memory but not as much clarity for that memory. Other features are good."
141,0,I want return it

Average phone at this price segment.Though the cameras are supposed to be high performance but not satisfied.Battery charged quickly and lasts for a full day only.Lookswise ok, Lenovo again a name you can trust upon.But don't buy with too much expectations, simply an average smart phone and off course good for rough use."
147,1,"Not expected about the k8 performance is that much,I'm really happy about the product in all specifications,and the thanks to Amazon for given me good and non damaged product in time."
148,1,"The best phone in terms of specifications, audio sound, battery, screen,camera, ram, rom alongwith corning gorilla glass. All the best things in a mobile without burning ur pocket."
149,1,Lacks some apps like pc connection etc.
150,1,Good phone after update
151,0,It's good
152,0,Not a good phone.. In only 2.5 month it started hanging with more than 25 GB available memory in the phone. Camera is not also good. Now Lenovo have to seriously think about the performance of their mid range phones.
153,0,Ye Amazon wale both b.c hai .. PHN kharida Lenovo k8 note Usme game ka hanging issue hai.. b.c replace k ly Bolte hai par behanchod Layla dete hai...

155,1,All things are good about this phone.Smoothly running and no problem till now
156,1,This phone is goodBut camera is not so good as 13mp...Over all it's good phone heating problem during charging
157,0,Worst depth effect honestly if you want to buy a phone with depth effect then go for Mi A1 but this is not for youIf you are a selfie holic then I recommend you to buy this phone bcz the selfie here is literally good as compare to other phones in this price range this phone is on top in terms of selfieIn terms of processor I'll say that Snapdragon 625 is much better then this bcz this phone will not save your battery as Redmi phones does and this processor is built on 20 nm technology and Snapdragon 625 is on 14 nm that's 625 is battery efficient but Lenovo is providing you fast charger which is about 15w so don't worry you can get your day battery in just 1 hr. If you plug your phone on 20% then it will get charge 70 to 80% in just 1 hr. Which can last upto 8 hrs.on minimal usage so if you really want to buy this one i'll recommend you to buy this but keep in mind some cons of this phone when you're buying it.

It may not be a serious issue for those who do not use mirroring.Worst thing was when I wanted a solution from Lenovo team through live chat, the person who was chatting, one Mr Saleem says K8 can cast only through chrome cast.further when I was typing my next question, he abruptly disconnected.There are also lot many posts by several users complaining about the casting issue on K8 note."

297,0,I had purchased on 08/10/2017 after using more than 15 days found that device fault of software Mobile getting hang and restart automatically .same issue consulting with Lenovo customer care as per there technical solutions till problem not solved.after that I was visited Lenovo care mapusa Goa as per there technical expertise need of software upgrade after software updated till issue not resolved. After this there technical expertise person said need of change of mother board .I have questions about Lenovo product that mobile not having any physical and water dimage then how could possible mother board probleam and in Goa there is no any Lenovo care centre in Margao and Panjim it's near about 50 km from Margao. So Weast of my valuable time which is more cost than my money and also weast of my money . please do not go for this product. Bad service faulty products.
298,1,This phone is very good...I like this phone
299,0,"Got the phone delivered on time . That is the only good thing in this entire experience of mine . (Updated now) a new update , the first update didn't provide any noticeable difference but this one's log looks promising, let's see..I have been using various models of mobiles , have never seen such a terrible device , . Bought this after much thoughts by trusting the name Lenevo .I have been using redmi note 4 & it never had any issues with battery or even camera . Listening to music through YouTube , Browsing, Facebook , Insta , still solid backup for more than a dayI have 4 other phones also , MOTO G3 & Samsung S3 , HTC 628G , Samsung J7 Prime .This phone(Lenevo K8) seems to be worst among all.1)Battery : Has left me shattered with its worst battery life , Have just used to take some pictures , YouTube & songs , it goes down very Fast . (Yet to enter two sim card & use WhatsApp , Gmail , so if it continues to become more worst I'd surely update & escalate this )2),Camera Quality(For a dual camera , it is nowhere near Honor 6x which is 1k lesser) .if you are tricked by the dual camera ( it still has not got update of slowmo , Time lapse ) but it is really good when taken in Professional Mode with manual iso & focussing.A disaster in auto mode , that too for a rear camera with dual lens .I wish the company wakes up and starts rolling out OTA update for Camera & Battery life improvement.Other than that , The phone is super smooth , Display , Touch , Finger print sensor & stock Android is a bit of self satisfaction that I can say to myself for wasting 14K .I thought of gifting it to my father , but this would make it surely an incomplete gift .!Wish the company looks into these issues & provides updates for the Camera & Battery life because that is what it was paid for & marketed by the company claiming those 2 are the highlight factors.Lost interest to Even post pictures of it.With much regret."
300,1,"It was launched as the next big thing in budget smartphones and claimed to have the best camera in that range.Phone is OK.Decent battery life, not the best but still a decent camera.After 4-5 months of use I found it starts to hang a bit but I guess that’s normal with low budget android devices."

335,0,Body is very heatingBattery usage is suddenly decrease
336,0,"After using few weeks I can say this phone has met all my expectations and I am completely satisfied with it, specially with camera and it’s effects, battery is up to the mark, Dolby speakers works really good ,no issues with memory, supports 4G on both SIM cards, wifi connectivity is also good...However there is some issue related to cell phone networks, specially during roaming areas, I could say there is small lack in the network chipset due to which sometimes it puts you in a situation where it’s doesnt shows you any kind of signal whereas other phones could get the network very easily.Overall performance is really good and satisfactory.Apart from this I haven’t received my jet previledge bonus points which I supposed to get for this order.Thanks"
337,0,From the begining it's google not responding.sometime it gives the feelings that i bought a second hand mobile.

438,0,"After around 3 months I finally came to a conclusion that this phone is average in all fields. Battery last for around 1 day of moderate usage after an overnight charge. Heating issues facing since the day I bought it. Gaming performance is good.I have tried all types of games including GTA San Andreas and Nova 3. There are no lags in the performance, the mediatek processor produce enough juice to pump the phone. I liked the selfie camera more than the primary one as the bokeh effect is crap and the single camera is also not good enough and here comes the major problem I'm having whenever any song is played on bluetooth connected speaker and the data is on the musoc starts distorting. Overall an average phone. I think there's more out there in this price range but it's not a complete failure. Regretting after buying."
439,0,Camera performance are not good

499,0,Not as expected. Average battery you have to charge two times daily. Dolby not working most of the time. Bluetooth issue when you connect the phone with a Bluetooth device and play a song or vedio audio breaking occurs most of the time. It's quite irritating. Contacted Lenovo help many times but could not find any solution.Please stay away from the phone. You can buy good alternates with this price

557,1,Supar phone
558,0,"To begin with, considering the price range I never had lot of expectations from this phone. Now that I have received it and used it for over 24 hours.. I would rate my experience as good!The touch of the phone is very good, soft and feels premium.Battery life is good however it does not show battery percentage on the main screen.Camera comes under average performance. The depth mode doesn't really serves the purpose here. Honor 6x has better camera than K8Performance of the phone is good.So overall, this is a good phone and when it comes to camera it's closest rival- Honor 6x takes the lead."
559,0,Its been only 1 month and it started giving trouble....its overheating and taking more hours for charging and giving less battery backup
560,0,Mobile is very good but it has heating issue..
561,0,Screen is not antiscratchScratch occurs in my mobile when it fall downBad gorilla glassScreen quality is not good
562,0,"Worst Battery Backup, Comes for only 6 hrs. Depth focussing camera is not effective as expected. Other features are good."
563,1,Nice mobile CPU is very best. I love it.
564,0,"Lenovo hyped this phone for it's Dual Rear Camera and a Deca Core MediaTek Processor and believe me these are the most worst things in this phone.Camera - The Dual Rear Camera is of No Use, It gives a fake bokeh effect. In depth enabled mode the camera struggles to focus. You will find the edges of the object are blurred along with the background. Without depth enabled mode both front and back cameras are just average.Processor & Battery - The Mediatek helio x23 processor is good in performance but since it is clocked at 2.3 ghz, the gets heated even on normal uses or while while charging. It aslo consumes the battery very fast, The 4000 mAH battery will hardly last for 1 day on normal uses.Sound Clarity - Nice Sound Clarity on speaker as well as earphone. Thanks to Dolby atmos.Display - Screen clarity is good.UI - Its a user choice, I am not a stock android fan as it lacks many features comes with custom roms like MIUI. Otherwise there is no problems with UI, it runs pretty smooth.Final verdict - Its just a average phone, there are many other good options available in market at same price point. If you are camera lover and want a good camera phone then go for Honor 6X, If You want good performance then go for Redmi Note 4 and If you want good performance with Stock Android then buy a Moto G5+"

577,1,perfect selfie phone
578,0,It gets very hot while using. I was using Lenovo K4 for last one year and was more satisfied with that rather this one @ 13999. Main drawback of this phone arebeautiful_ Cast (screen mirror) doesn't work. Bluetooth is also disturbing. Touch screen is not as sensitive as it should be with 4gb ram and 64 GB internal memory with 10 core processer. Display got broken very early with in two months of use. It's very normal and not as strong as k4. Hand grip is not good. Voice clarity not good and Dolby sound is just normal and speakers are very normal and sound is low. K4 was much better in this regard. Call logs and call recording another big drawback of this phone. I will not recommend this phone for purchase even @ the cost of 10k.
579,0,Not too good
580,1,All good but fingerprint sensor not working sometime..

733,1,Very superb lenovo k8 but please impore the camera setting and plz gives the updates.......and battery backup awesome
734,0,"Mobile goes to very heat, not user friendly, like no speed dial, no screenshot, less dial settings, fast discharging, can't send via Bluetooth, etc...I want to return or I should sell this mobile. I am disappointed. Just Only worth for cost."
735,1,very good prdt
736,1,Camera quality was not up to given standardsVery impressed with fast charging as well as battery backup.Wothy mobile at this price
737,1,Not the beast ... Camera's depth sensing is not that good though very good selfie camera ..chipset is way powerfull... Battery drains fast but after a software update it's ok now
738,0,Worst product....screen cast won't work which is a basic feature
739,1,Yes
740,0,Delicate. Screen was broken and cost Rs.4500 waste of money
741,0,"I Purchased this phone , but i recommend to buy MI A1 or Honor 6x in this price segment .. Lenovo is lazy in terms of providing updates .phone have serious bugs in camera depth mode ,slow motion video is pathetic .. you will never gona use it ,front camera gives soft pictures,background app crashes ,flicking screen is there (not much),these bugs could be cured by throwing an update ,. but Lenovo will not do it , because if they made this phone perfect who will gona buy there ""moto"" phones !!phone is good in terms of design and screen , it feels good in hand, stock android is a bonus."
742,1,Worth to use online usage
743,0,"As soon as I bought the mobile from the courier person, I eagerly transferred songs from my older mobile and started the Google music player in Lenovo k8 Note to experience it's fantastic Dolby Atmos Surround Sound which I had experienced in Lenovo k4 Note. But I was very much disappointed that Lenovo k8 Note doesn't provide Dolby Atmos Surround sound AT ALL.Dear manufacturers, Kindly take your previous edition Lenovo k4 Note and check it's sound and compare it with k8. It is worst as your competitor's Dolby Atmos. Don't replicate those duplicate Dolby Atmos. Come back again with dual Front facing Speakers as Lenovo k4 which has excellent Dolby Atmos experience. And even, using top branded Headphone, did not give much difference between 'With Dolby Atmos' and 'Without Dolby Atmos' option.The main reason why I bought :Lenovo k8 Note is the Lenovo's Real Dolby Atmos sound (as i thought before buying), otherwise your competiror has all other specifications as K8. But even Lenovo started making false promise (like your competitor) that the mobile has 'Dolby Atmos' by just enabling some Equilizer options like just we had in 2000's mobiles, but the output is 'Null'."
744,1,Good mobile for the price
745,1,Till date excellent product
746,0,Waste mobile no signal in mobile
747,0,"Worst product supplied by Amazon trader. Received my new phone today dated 05/09/2017, after installing Google services and my account it immediately showing blur screen and not a single button works. I have made 2-3 videos in my mobile which I definitely going to post on social media sites to aware people for not to buy Lenove K8 note."
748,0,Worst phone..Batry bckup is worst....Suddenly while playing games it stops working from the first day i have gone to its service center they told that we have to update its software..they called me at 2 pm but i have gone to 4 pm to them but then were tlng it will take 1 more hour and after 1 hour they told that you will get your handset tommorow....after soft update also this problem continued..And now i m returning it..Call quality is worst...my opposite side person unables to hear my voice clearly....and headphone jack also not working...when it just gets touched by my finger sound stops ar video get paused.
749,0,Battery back problem
750,0,"Nothing extraordinary to call it a killer note. Camera which lenovo has boasted of, is poor like all previous lenovo phones, The dual camera setup is just a gimmick and takes ordinary quality photos. Dolby atmos sound output is of average quality, it was better on earlier lenovo's. The headset volume while on call is very low compared to previous lenovo's, redmi & mi, samsung's. Making K8 note pure android experience, lenovo has robbed users of some good features available on the previous lenovo's. Hence the software is a big let down, lenovo should have stripped down the vibe UI to near stock experience instead of dumping it. Also, a phone cant be called a killer if it doesnt have the basic function of backlit keys at the bottom. Software experience is not smooth as it should be considering the ram and motherboard and coupled with stock android.In my opinion, K8 note is nothing of what it was projected to be and the previous lenovo's were slightly better minus the full hd displays on them."
751,0,I have faced phone ringing issue!! I need to repair it!!!
752,0,Good

756,0,waste of money
757,0,Not a good mobile
758,1,Very nice phone.Camera is very good.No heating issue.Very satisfied.
759,0,"Hi all, I have bought new lenovo k8 note. Frankly speaking lenovo making fool to customer through this product. Just for marketing they have given higher features in this price(like 4gb ram, 64gb ROM, dual camera) but all are of no use. If you buy some other company with lesser feature compared to this you will get much better experience. The most stupid thing lenovo done is very basic features they have removed like led notification is there but it never works except during charging, no call recording, no shortcuts for screen shot. I got alert saying low. Battery and 15% was there then automatically switched off immediately.These feedback by just exploring little, let me explore more than i ll share with more feedback"
760,1,"Features at this price are not regrettable but the price slashed by 1000 in just one month made me think about the brand as a wholeso. All said, it is a decent deal at this price if you are not concerned about the camera quality."
761,1,Good phone in this price.

773,0,I'm So sad because I'm not satisfy about this phone. 1st from day first network problem not sporting 4g sim 4g network. I'm using Airtel sim I never got full network in this phone. I changed slot 1 slot 2 but always week network. Same sim when I'm using in my other phone Oppo A57 it's working good. Getting heat while charging. You can see in pictures below attached. In second slot also I'm using Airtel but when I start switch on internet my network lost automatically. I seen YouTube Lenovo customer reviews vedio with same problem. Now I'm so sad because I waisted my money with This phone. Redmi is much better then Lenovo in this price. In future I never will try to buy Lenovo /Moto .im very disappointed .
774,1,So far no issues with performance .Best phone in this budget.
775,1,SUPER CAMERA AND BEST PERFORMANCE

787,1,Wow so amazing phone
788,1,The Lenovo K8 note is really a killer phone if you are searching for a smart phone that is totally balanced from all prospects then this is your phone.😍But why Lenovo why you used mediatek😭
789,0,"Very bad experience with the product and also with the amazon policy. The mobile is getting very hot while charging, talking on phone, listening of music. Don't trust on Lenovo K8 Note while purchasing online."
790,0,Don't Buy this phone at all its Batteries Draining Very Fast and Camera's Qualities very poor on return request phone has been tested through their software showing everything ok just check the credentials that software poor rank given by all.See the photos and Qualities of 13 Mega Pixels are no worth of 5 Mega Pixels.Lenovo Killer Note 8 poor than Lenovo Vibe 5.
791,1,Super mobile
792,0,"Don't take this phone,Camera is not good as of 13 mp, specially front one is worst.Heating problem is occurred during little bit heavy use like on playing game and video's.It is heated up drastically on calling.I want to return it but Amazon refused to take it back.Over all, not good it is."

813,0,"Lenovo K8 Note (Venom Black, 4GB) with New System Update where is the system update, We have to check the update, only os 7.1.1 is updated(naught) Not Oreo 8.1 . Then why you are mentioning it as with system update.The Purchase date of the mobile was 20/09/2017 and the warranty expires in 8 days (on 08/June/2018) when checked online on the Lenovo Product Check (official Lenovo Warrenty Check)"
814,0,Over all performance is good but phone is getting heated up when plugged into charging.. will suggest to go for redmi note 4 instead of lenovo k8...
815,0,"- Primary camera not worthy- Cast screen not able to detect any smart TV's- Screen sharing option not available- No Parallel apps options- Unable Wifi connections though strong Wifi- Mobile data connection breaks for every minute- Screenshot option is pathetic- Many smart options which are available in budget phones are not available in this phone.- Heating and hanging is another problem- Could not able to find call recording options.Looks to me most of problems can be resolved with appropriate updates and software enhancements so I will amend rating once Lenovo address above issues, If Lenovo not keen to address basic issues then you will get better options even in budget phones also."
816,1,I thought I'll b getting earphones with the box but it's just a phone
817,1,Superbbb!!
818,1,Excellent in all respect.
819,0,Finger print scanner has stopped working

821,0,From the very next day the finger print lock sensor Of the handset stopped working.
822,0,Network and battery heating prob
823,0,Data cable of this product is not working
824,0,The product is not worth the money at all. The battery backup is very bad and phone keeps on restarting frequently. Would like to get another product or refund.
825,0,This Lenovo divice is overheated while charging and while mobile data turned on.
826,1,Lenovo not give the task manager and camera is best but one speaker is not work. And cellular network is very good.
827,1,I use this phone i feel good
828,0,Its deliver 1day prior to scheduled time which was nice. Specification says its a VoLTE supported phone but in reality its NOT. Need to install a jio4GVoice if want to use jio sim in it for making and receiving calls. Cant make or receive calls on Jio network if connected to wifi which is pathetic. Overall I am not happy due to all of these issues.
829,1,"Great phone, with the stock Android it's the smoothest phone that I have used till date. The built quality is also descent and the front and rear cameras perform good. This phone is for heavy users like me . And the 4000 mAh battery is good enough for a full day's work. If you are looking for a phone that is all rounder in this range, the k8 note is always a great option. One thing that i left out is the sound quality which is good being backed by dolby Atmos . This 4gb ram varient is very good. Although the 3gb ram varient has some issues . But this one is completely fine."
830,0,Very bad product from lenovo battery is overheating so much
831,0,"I bought this phone in first sale. I inserted one of my two mobile SIMs & then started updating/downloading the application and then thought to insert the second SIM. When I tried to do so, the SIM slot was not opening at all. I have raised the return request but unable to do so as no one is able to remove the SIM card, even mobile repairing shops.Charging is not fast.Dual camera is better than regular 13 MP.Mobile is just OK.Amazon team helped in refund process. Happy with Amazon but I may not buy this phone again."
832,0,"Lot's of issues, bo not buy this phone"
833,1,Super
834,0,Not so good.Expected better product.The phone is little bit slow & battery is not that good.Brought at high price.Later price dropped.
835,1,"Overall satisfied, value for money no doubt in that. But battery performance is not up to Mark. Earlier was using Panasonic eluga a2 with 4000 mAh battery which will last whole day and will be about 34% -25% balance charge. But this one draining battery faster. Overall it's good choice. Turbo charger also not giving any speed to change fast. Actually it's taking 1 hour to 1:30 hours to charge full"
836,1,lt's very awesome handset and features are excellent and specially it's easy to operate
837,0,"Camera not capturing pictures,and the battery is like 2000 mah the mobile sucks waste of money expected alot from the Lenovo but it failed"
838,0,"I am received the Lenovo k8 note ,i am using this mobile eighteen days. The main problem is battery draining is very fast. Battery is taking 4 hours to charge and getting drain in 6 hours. Incoming calls not receiving at times even though full signal. It's Consume very much memory. Heating issue comes after some hour use. Dual rear camera is not working. Always hanging this phone,,,It's quality is too bad.Not something good for buying.Also Amazon has a cheating policy now a days for return and refund. They are asking for some local app to check the phone. Which doesn't have battery checking option."
839,0,"The games start to lag a little bit after playing for a hour and gets heated up (not expecting from new phone , don't know what happens when it gets old ) but phone have rigid body , phone ram fills up to 75% sometimes not so handy while gaming.......and finally stop decreasing it's cost it hurts us a lot😂😂"
840,1,Phone is good...best in class..but battery is not much like 4000
841,1,With respect to price and features...this is a perfect smart phone that anyone can have it.
842,0,There is a heating issue in this device and finger print sensor does not work in 1st time........
843,1,"I'd say it's a OK phone. Heating up like a hell. Otherwise it's a OK phone. If you're a gamer, I'd recommend not to buy this phone."
844,1,Jhakass

848,0,"I purchased Lenovo k8 note on 26th September, it's working good for two months. Suddenly problem arises, didn't understand what happened suddenly, phone getting discharged fastly and when I charge the phone it will take more time almost 6hrs to complete full charge and moreover phone is getting too heat while charging. It's not happened for first two months., but it's totally disappointed.Is there any chances in getting exchange to the product"
849,0,Waste of money
850,1,If you are looking for simple and sweet phone then go with this handset.. If you are a basic user like using normal whatsapp instagram nad few other apps in daily usage then it is good.... Battery life is average. Camera is also average..... You can say it is giving the performance for the price which you are paying.
851,1,Nice phn
852,1,"Writing this review after eight months of using this phone, this phone is very good in it's build qualitySupereb! Front 13 megapixel camera with quit powerful front flash. Performance is very good I play a lot of games does not lag in gameing.Cons- when talking about the cons of this product is that, the Bokeh mode and the blur effect is not very good just average same goes to Battey backup just a bit less not as good as MI phones on heavy usage you have to charge it again in the evening."
853,0,Bluetooth is not working properly with my speaker getting breaking sound most of the time

859,0,Battery backup is not good. Full charge lasts upto 8 hours medium utilization. Camera quality is also not good. Sometimes hangs and heating issue.Don't buy at this price. Go for Mi A1. Similar configuration at 14999.
860,0,Phone are regularly heat and his temperature is continue to over heat.Video song is not clearly play.Battery back up is very poor because phone are continue to heat in time of open mobile data and charging

863,1,The best product released by LenovoWhich gives a excellent performance in gaming and multi tasking and the best feature in this phone is the split screen
864,1,Excellent phone better than redmi note 4. It does heat up occasionally not every time and that too not that much. Battery performance is I would say above average as it lasts almost 1 day with 4000 mah battery. Performance is great. No complaints with the phone. Loved it.
865,1,Best phone in this Price range( 10k) .. Updated software removed all previous issue
866,1,good product.

875,0,"Worst ever phone of my life,,,, dont purchase its horrible"
876,0,"This can be a good product if Lenovo improves its Depth Camera, battery life and not so good Network connectivity.Otherwise cool product.Turbo charging takes 2+ hrs to fully charge.Depth camera looks like some sort of software tweak."
877,0,Very poor battery. Phone heats slot and take 2.5 hours to charge there is no turbo charging.
878,1,Ummaah to Bolby ATMOS. I love this device also due to stock Android OS. Bass is very detailed. Use 16 Ohms earphones (Sennheiser CX 300 II or CX 180 only as they'll give enough loudness. I love its sound output. Audio output is 3 times better than my iPhone. Motorola and Lenovo are my permanent brands from now. I regret for returning my Moto G6. People are fools who buy any other brand when it comes to Android OS. Google should consider Motorola phones as their flagship device.
879,0,After 5 days of usage I find some issues in my Lenovo K8 note. Whenever I install a new app I can't find the app in my app list. When this happens I should restart my phone then only I can see the app in my app list.Not only that whenever I use my share it and minimises it then I found some glitches on my lock screen and home screen also and this happen with Asphalt 8 too.Please tell me someone that why this happens to my Lenovo k8 note and what should I do this.is there anyone to know about this please tell me...

882,1,Very good product
883,0,"Signal reception is bad. Mobile data does not work well. As it's dual standby, only one sim can be used for data at once. If you have jio, either you can use it for data and other sim for calls or you have to switch to the other sim.Turbo charging is fine."
884,1,V V GOOD

899,1,Great mobile
900,1,Thanks for your phone
901,1,Evrything okk but camera quality and music quality not good like we expected
902,0,Not like at all.Battery backup is poor and dual camera setup is worst.Navigation keys on bottom without back light is made it worst.

910,1,Best mobile...
911,0,This mobile is too bad once you update I update my mobile then I face too much heating issue and mobile apps are not working and also there is battery drainage issue after Oreo updation pathetic product by lenovo
912,0,Ear phones not given
913,0,Absolutely useless phone in this range. Pls don't go for it. Battery worst.
914,0,"Nothing great in this phone except good battery life. Phone heats a lot. Function buttons at the bottom do not have backlight, this is a big issue if you know. Sound is ok. Size is too big."
915,1,It's really really good phone with small price. Sound quality is very good. I had tried many brands in past but none has worked out well for me. Thanks to Amazon.
916,0,"product not soo good its ok. And in this product gives dual camera but use only one camera, main mobile over heat issue"
917,0,Heating issue..........
918,0,"It's Heats up in short time , for charging it's takes around 3 to 4 hour and worst part takes same time to drain without using it for whatsup , You tube,or gaming feels Hot in hand. Holding Phone more than 10 to 15 min feels scary too as if it will gets Burst . Long charging time huge issue."
919,0,I bought this phone on flash sell for Rs13999. Now it is in the price range below Rs.12000. The reason is obvious. Very poor battery back up. Camera is below average. Finger sensor is staggering to recognise. Sometimes hanged to execute simple applications which ran smoothly in my earlier smart phone whose configurations are far below than this. I assure what they promised actually is a total failure. Don't waste your valuable money into it. I doubt whether the company can rectify or upgrade the performance by software upgradation. The only positive think (?) Is it's look and screen size. Feeling sorry how Amazon can promote this product with such vigorous advertisement.
920,0,Mobile is too bad and lot of network issue
921,1,Good product with good packaging.
922,0,"Fake dual camera... Depth mode is of no use. Its just edits the pic and the produced pic feeld like badly edited... Battery sucks... Heating problem... No Volte... Jio sim won't work unless you use jio app. Dual Camera is fake... Even when you place you finger in front of the 5MP camera, your phone will still take a blurred background pic which clearly says that the pics are edited and the 2nd 5MP camera is of no use."

Iam using this for a month and I'm fully satisfied. One point i like to add here is,other than fingerprint the face recognition works soo good and unlocks in less than 0.5 seconds . This phone had a very great user experience. Thanks to lenovo.But one disadvantage is that it doesn't support screen cast to smart televisions and other devices."

947,0,"I ordered this phone and it showed that they would deliver me the latest version of android 8.0 Oreo. They delivered me a old version and as well as the device was faulty. I showed this phone to the lenovo service center, they said that this device is faulty and suggested that we should return this back to amazon. I then contacted the amazon customer care service but they refused to take the device back as the device return period was over which is completely accepted by me but these guys cheated on me as they delivered me a faulty piece and refused to take the phone back. The phone does not catch the signal of the WiFi even if the router is next to it. I also have two tablets of lenovo, they connect to WiFi instantly from anywhere in the house, this was happening because of the old 7.1.1 Noughat version so I went to the lenovo service center and upgraded it to a android 8.0 Oreo but then the condition became even worse and it also stopped getting signal. I am not satisfied with my device and I want this faulty device to be taken back by amazon and return me my Rs.11650. The Amazon has cheated on me as the return back policy does not allow me to make a replacement of this device. I want amazon to tale back my device as soon as possible."

954,0,"I have bought this phone from offline store, next month in May it would be 1 year that I am using this phone. The phone is good, camera good in lighted areas, speed is good, battery is good but what has annoyed me the most is the temperature. You charge the phone, surf, use social media, play games, do whatever, it heats up so much that you won't be able to hold it. I play games, i use two usb fans, connected to my laptop, pointed at the back of the phone, and a damp cloth to keep playing. It heats up with in 5 minutes of playing any game. When I charge, i keep the fan running. For just this one issue all the plus points of this phone goes down the drain. In would not buy another lenovo and would not recommend buying K8 note."

It's a tad big for my taste, but decent. It does not get a proper screen guard, as it's little curved from sides, screen guards don't stick from corners or sides. Ram although 4 gb on paper, actually it's only 3.7, n out of it too 3 pre occupied mostly.Decent enough 100% worth your money, only competition I can think of is redmi note 5"

Even though there a slight increase of 500 mah bettery life, but you wont experience that increase. While taking photo, shot on the screen appear smaller than Vibe K5 note. But low light photos are slighly better in Lenovo K8 note. Even some of the features are missing in Lenovo K8 note like super battery save mode etc. Not that great buy."

1017,0,An okay phone. Nothing to make a wow feel. Battery drains very fast. I don't know how does a 4000 mah LiP battery drains like this. Can't stay with phone in on mode in night even if u charged 100℅ in the morning. Camera is average. Processes very fast and no hang or delay in accessing apps and all. I won't recommend this phone. This is a genuine review after a 2 weeks very hard core use.

1038,1,Superfast Experience with 2.3Ghz Deca Core Processor.
1039,0,I would recommend everyone to not buy mediatek chip enabled phones Lenovo is still a very good company you can look for Lenovo p2 the fastest charging on the world with the highest battery backup and with Samsung's Super AMOLED display and Sony Camera go for it without any doubts.And with the best chip I.e. sd 625 at only 13499 on Flipkart

1047,1,Good
1048,0,The phone is hanging maximum times and battery is draining rapidly than my earlier Lenovo K8 note.what is the reason I don't know.
1049,0,"I am writing this review after 3 months of usage. I received quite a number of software updates. I am happy on that front. The software experience is just fantastic. It is currently running Oreo. The portrait mode is just ok. Nothing exceptional. The camera modes are good too. I feel the RAM management could have been better. Coming to the main part. The battery life is utter nuisance. It doesn't hold up like a 4000mAh battery. If u r willing to purchase it for its battery, please stay away. I charged the battery to 80 percent in the morning at around 8.30 n found the battery to be 52 percent at around 4 p.m. The thing to be noticed is that the device was used not a bit. It was idling the whole while. The performance of the phone is very good. It does get warm while charging and playing games but nothing unbearable."
1050,0,"except camera, I think rest of the other stuff is same like other Lenovo phones, I don't feel this phone have any extra ordinary quality. Look and feel is total LOW QUALITY PHONEMONEY WASTE dual camera is not workingWorst phone by Lenovo...All the application suddenly stops working while using it...If it's the last phone on earth still don't buy. Lenovo claims deca core processor but performancene is lesser than the phone having four core processor."

1053,1,Good phone and Excellent features for this price
1054,0,"It's worst phone.amazon is the one reason to by this phone . Amazon ad shows(good killer performance,good camera quality, battery back,etc...).. It's not worth for this.Already i have HTC desire 816g . lenonvo is not worth for that..Lenonvo is worst company they give a fake ads"
1055,0,Bad phone
1056,0,Its got Heating Problem.. and finger print unlock is like only for phone and the 5 MP Back camera is a Drawback. Its not a WATER REPELLENT PHONE. Lenovo doesnt have any water proof phone.. so DONT BUY this phone .. i really had a bad experience with Phone and service center people..and if you go to Lenovo service center for warranty these people will talk about their policies first instead of providing a solution . They cant solve any of your phone issue and they move on.
1057,0,not satisfied
1058,0,Worst phone ever seen for that price range. Waste of money
1059,1,Very good
1060,0,DONT EVER BUY THIS MOBILE BECAUSE IT DOES NOT HAVE SCREEN MIRROR FEATURE .EVEN CHEAP MOBILES HAVE THIS FEATURE.
1061,0,"This review is a exact outcome of using this mobile for more than a month.Pros and Cons:--------------------------1. Battery backup close to 2 days approximately including idle time, internet and call usage. So rest assured, you are in good hands. I have attached screenshot of my battery usage.Note: Keep your mobile charge for at least 8 hours before the first time use.2. Turbo charge great as expected. So yes, it gives your cell more time in hand.3. Camera HDR feature really capture detailed images. Front camera with flash is a nice feature.4. This phone works with 4G, 3G and 2G speeds.5. Dual separate Nano Sim slot and additionally it has separate memory card slot for external storage. You will never run out of storage issues.6. Fingerprint sensor response time is very faster and you can use the same for taking photos. Additionally you can use it as a App lock for unlocking important apps.But you have to install separate app from play store (Cons).7. Google personal assistant feature is awesome.8. Dedicated Music key in left. But you can also use this as a shortcut for few useful actions like taking screenshot and camera.9. Call management is really difficult, need to download apps from play store for setting call waiting and etc.. (Cons)10. Voice recorder need to be downloaded separately (Cons)11. Hardware is really awesome but software needs lots of customization. (Cons)12. Just Double Tap to awake the phone and you can see the time and date without unlocking it.13. Press the Volume key and click on the Bell symbol to put your phone on vibrate and silent.There should be some shortcut has to be provided for this (Cons)14. Design of this phone is an absolute killer.15. Cast screen option is only supported with chrome cast device. So you cannot share anything with smart TV without this casting device. (Cons)However you can play YouTube videos from phone to Smart TV with inbuilt YouTube application which comes with casting.Overall it's a good phone and worthy for money you pay, because it has lot customizations needed to be done and have to download apps for basic things. so My rating is 4 stars.."
1062,1,Perfect mobile in this budget
1063,0,Mobile overheating not not backup in battery
1064,1,Overall nice performance..

1070,0,The product I received is defective. One of the two is not working. Left speaker is not working and right speaker is working. I want to replace the product but the steps for returning the product is not proper on Amazon. It says to down load the smart check app. I did that and run the app. But the app says my product is good. I called Amazon and explained the issue. He says to move to nearest authorised service center and get the letter that the product is defective. Don't know how the problem will be settled.

1074,0,"Lenovo always has great Specs on Paper and Poor Performance & stability in real-life.This is my 3rd & last Lenovo (over 6 years) - K3 Note didn't work well. VIBE had battery reboot issues and went to repair center twice. Now This.K8-Note Issues(1) Very poor battery. Particularly with GPS on, it dies far more rapidly than Samsung or any other phone(2) Poor drivers. When I plug in the ear phone and remove them, the normal speaker stops working. Can't hear voice on incoming calls. Needs reboot.(3) WiFi is flaky. Connection drops suddenly. Picks up again.(4) Hangs when multiple Apps are opened. Suddenly you find you cannot even take incoming calls.All this WITHIN 6-8 months of purchase of the phone.Adieu Lenovo. I tried hard to like you."
1075,1,The killer note's KILLER indeed.

1093,1,Good phone .Nice camera Nice look
1094,0,Waste brand LENOVO NOT VALUE FOR MONEY PRODUCTS
1095,0,"Good mobile.solid build. Multitasking is so buttery. Ram management can be better, Lenovo need to work on this. Battery backup is better after the recent September security patch.Dual camera setup is just a gimmick, The dept mode is just waste of time and money. Single primary camera from both front and back take decent pics. Camera app definitely need improvement.The capacitive buttons are not backlit, but didn't faced any issues in dark.The most annoying thing about the mobile is, suddenly a popup raises and says Amazon app is not responding or some other 'X' app is not responding and sometimes I am not able to launch some heavy apps after installing from Google play store.Mobile heatsup only while charging, didn't faced issue while playing games like Asphalt air borne, war robots. But there were frame drops while playing war robots."
1096,1,Powerful phone
1097,1,Nice
1098,1,reasonable price...better phone...fast delivery..thank you..amazone
1099,1,Excellent product
1100,0,Good phone..lot of improvements in camera..however battery back up is bad compare to earlier Lenovo phone like Vibe p1 turbo. K8 note lacks feature of restricting auto start of apps which was there in earlier phones. Hence battery drains fast in K8 note.Though turbo charging but it takes almost 2 hours to full charge.Also one of the most irritating thing is notification volume is same as ring volume which disturbs your routine because if you keep ring volume high then notification sound is also highNo schedule power on-off featureWe expect some add-on features by Lenovo to overcome these issues
1101,0,Every thing seems good except the battery life.
1102,0,There is some issues in the phone. In status bar time is not updating properly.sound quality is bad I think it's software issue. It vary time to time.headphone sound is not buzzing
1103,0,"Lenovo K6 power is better in many ways than the k8 note like low budget (9999&10999), good speaker sound ( more loud & clear sound than k8 note) with dual speaker back side (k8 note has only 1 speaker at bottom), more battery backup with same 4000mah battery( k6 power's battery consumption is very less than k8 note, you can use k6 powwr for more hours than the k8 note with full charged battery), comfortable Size (5"" screen, easily fit in pocket), free in-box earphones (in k8 note earphones are not provided), more features than k8 note.K6 power lounched 6months before lounching of k8 note. But still it(k8 note) doesn't have functionality which k6 power already has.Functions which is not in k8 note are as follows:1) Wide touch(to lock phone, shortcut for many recent app, its just like apple button)2) quick snap (double tap volume button to take screen shot)3) smart scene (to open any action by time or by on connecting any device like wifi etc, by this function you can set your brightness low for night time by set action time 8:00 pm - 7:00 am, or silent your phone between office hours automatically many other things)4) fingerprint snap: you can take photos by touching fingerprint sensor)5)dual app profile: (two WhatsApp/fb account simultaneously)6) quick flashlight: (by tapping home button twice)7) secure zone, guest mode: (in secure zone you can install same apps with different account and that apps can only work when you open secure zone with password)"
1104,0,"The phone seems alright with just about 2 weeks of using it. I did come across an error with the phone.process stopped responding and I had to restart my new phone. Hangouts is another app that just crashed when I started using it on this phone. Lastly, the battery is not exactly living up to the expectations of being a 4000 mAh battery. Else the features, look, audio, camera are all good. It's quite smooth is handling it.There is no headset that comes along with this handset."

1131,0,Heating and network problem
1132,0,"1. Dual Stand BY 4G2. Not Good Camera [Redmi Note 4 has same issue]3. Stock Android but needs to be optimized and should have better RAM/Battery ManagementUser can choose K8 Note or Redmi Note 4 both are fine if one ask you to choose from.Redmi note 4 has plus for the MIUI and its customization while K8 Note has bit [tiny] better on paper specs, 13mp Selfi Camera"
1133,1,Super
1134,0,Camera is not good
1135,0,"Not at all recommended. My Lenovo K8 has the following issues:1. Poor signal strength - Tried different SIMs like Vodafone, JIO, etc, But signal shows only 2-3 bars. Whereas the same SIMs when inserted in other 4G handsets, it shows full strength n no call drops.2. Heating Problem: The company has added 4000 mAh battery because they knew that this handset will get heated and drained battery quickly. On using simple day-to-day work, it gets heated like anything. And the full battery drains within half day."
1136,0,"Lenovo k8 note looks good, but from last morning it has started getting ON/OFF in every second. I am not able to either switch it OFF or ON."

1140,0,"I am utterly disappointed with the brand itself. The K series was hyped up due to its packed specifications. But this particular mobile went down the drain in less than 6 months.Things I want to specify about this mobile:1. The mobile is quite heavy, not pocket-friendly2. Picture quality is average for dual rear camera and the front camera isn’t good either.3. The mobile heats up real fast while watching a video or in a call.4. At some point, The turbo charging stopped working, it took forever to charge it back.5. I don’t like the resolution of the phone either.I’ve given away my mobile to the customer service, Hope it survives. Better not go for this mobile."
1141,1,The phone is good. However the Bluetooth is flaky at times.
1142,0,"In promotion they said it has Gorilla glass,but today my mobile got big scrach on the screen just I kept in my pocket. This product does not have Gorilla glass"

1171,0,"Worst phone. It takes at least 10-15 seconds to unlock thru finger print. Even power button also takes few seconds to open the screen for unlock. While talking on phone, if you have to see some thing like any message, then it takes 5-6 seconds for screen lights to come up once you move it away from your ear. Never buy this worst phone. Operating system is pathetic."

1191,1,ok super
1192,0,"YesI had great expectations while buying this post review. But turned out to be a thumbs downWhile Lenova K8 note comes with amazing configuration, it could not stand out to my previously used MI note 3 which I bought for 9k 2 years back. Battery backup,camera features, sound quality, music and video apps , swiftness , call quality were all below average."
1193,1,Nice mobile below 10k range.Battery life is really long lasting. Not lagging though I have fulled my memory n install more than 150 apps.Cons. Screen mirroring is only with google chrome.

1197,1,"I am not a vivid user of a lot of phones, however looking at the feature, I went for this one. As of now, I am happy with the decision. The phone does not heat up, has a great speed and camera.Only feedback is to provide headphones with the pack.

Gud thing is the camera quality.I faced a problem with the battery performance. It takes 6 - 7 hours for charging 80% battery. I approach Lenovo service center, they are not able to resolve this issue, last 3 days my phone is with the service center. I tried Amazon for the replacement thay are also not supporting since it this more than 10 days of purchase date.I also heard from my friend this model is having more defects the feedback he got from service center.

1236,1,"Amazing phone, worth for 12,999."
1237,1,Good phone
1238,0,Over all phone is good . Turbo charger is not actual turbo we can it is fast charger only . Phone lacks in rear camera quality . In low light performance is very poor . Bhokeh effect is not working okay . If u want to buy it for photography don't go for it . U can get better option cool 1 dual as better option for photography. I am using both phones
1239,1,Phone is average. Not as Lenovo promised. There is no turbo charging. Sometimes it lags too and camera quality is also normal. Touch and screen is impressive. In my views it is just an average phone not something to hype about.
1240,0,Head phone is missing in the box
1241,0,Very worst product... Amazon delivering unworthy items...
1242,1,"Lenovo K8 Note (Venom Black, 4GB)"
1243,1,Best buy with maximum features & performance...
1244,0,"So apparently, if your charger cable degrades, you have to shell out Rs 1500 to replace your Mobile Charging port too. Why you ask? Because they can not connect phone to PC using ""broken"" cable (Not any other working cable, because that is against their Policy), so they diagnosed that charging port too must be faulty. I am amused how many ways people come up with to cheat customers."
1245,1,Got the product within 2 days. Excellent phone. The packaging could have been better. Recommended for all.
1246,0,"Not working properly :- 1) Not supporting Word & Excell files.2) Battery heat up quickly & prone to life risk due to blast.3)On using any application, Phone heat up immediately/quickly & battery discharges."

1256,0,The speakers doessnot work properly
1257,1,Ok

1259,1,Gud to buy with some heating related issues otherwise gud to buy
1260,1,Nice phone ...Great battery backup n camera ..Thanks to amazon
1261,0,"Lenovo K8 note quality issue! Very disappointed! I purchased Lenovo K8 note on 18th August 2017. I was very disappointed to find that whenever I stream videos online or download videos from internet, the videos lacks sharpness and accurate colour reproduction even at higher resolutions! The videos are unwatchable! But the same videos look perfect when they are transferred to internal memory of the phone or SD card via a computer or any other storage drive. Even the videos shot on Lenovo K8 look perfect. The quality issue occurs only when you stream or download videos from the internet! Such poor quality control from Lenovo is just not acceptable! Also, the LED notification light doesn't work with Whatsapp, Messenger, Facebook etc. It only activates when you have an unread SMS, email and missed calls. It does not work with any other app!! There is no such thing as fast charging in this phone even though it is mentioned on the box! The 4000 mah battery takes more than 2 hrs to charge and if you are using the phone while charging then it may take indefinite time to charge completely. Moreover the battery drains so quickly that you may think you are using a 2500 mah battery phone. Just lasts for 3/4th day even with casual to moderate use! Be-aware guys if you are going for this phone be ready to compromise on video viewing quality, basic functions of LED notification light, battery life and battery charging time!"
1262,1,Heating

1342,0,"The phone is ok but since december 25th,the JIO network calls&messaging did nt work.The service centre here in Chennai informed me that the OS is old one & has to be upgraded to get the JIO work properly.Hence,I would like a replacement for the phone as it is within the 6 months period having purchased in august,2017"
1343,1,First of all would like to say that Amazon gives amazing delivery service..About the phone I would say its damn good masha allah... U can go for it. It really is a killer phone.. I am reviewing about this phone after the use of 6 months and is still my favourite.. there is no problem with it at all.

1347,1,Awesome product.
1348,0,Not sure about other features ... but the battery backup is poor. Atleast Lenovo could not maintain the same level of quality in this product. I purchased the one .. and after a week found ~30% battery drain overnight when the phone was completely idle. It stared draining 8 to 10% in 10 mint of usage. Called customer care ... they connected the device via SmartTest app and noted the problem. Thanks to Amazon ... within couple of days they replaced and delivered a new one. The same story repeated again ... this time they arranged a technician visit ... as per his report Amazon scheduled the pick up and arranged the refund. Thanks Amazon for wonderful customer service. Now Im really scared to buy such things from stores. Im sure they will not take it back and will advise me to go to service center.

1416,0,"i am not a big fan of lenovo, but i was compelled to buy this product due to its specs at a reasonably low rate and i was correct lenovo has done nly one thing rite to quire motorola and that can only save them. I am using lenovo k8 note for past 1 month andi have started getting issues like heating , at times too slow for the basic use itself. These cons can be accepted but for the past few days i am getting issues with charging, it cahrges for few minutes then automatically it stops. Really a bad experience with phone with usage of 1 month only"
1417,0,"[Initial Review: 22-Aug-2017]I've been using this phone for last 3 days, so this is kind of initial review. Buying experience and delivery was crisp thanks to Amazon Prime, amazing.1. The design is not a eye catcher, but nothing wrong about it either2. The camera is OK and nothing impressive. Low light photography is grainy3. Heating is a serious problem. It gets hot after long usage. Not unbearable, but not desirable either4. OS is nice and close to stock. Addition of some Moto s/w makes it even better5. No lag or performance issue so far4. Display is good but on the dimmer side. Would loved to see a brighter display6. Battery back up and fast charge work fine7. Sound through good earphone is above the price rangeVerdict: Before jumping into conclusion you might want to consider LG Q6 and to be launched Nokia 6 or better Redmi Note4                                                                                       [UPDATE#1 : 25-Aug-2017]It's been a week since I'm using this. Below is the update in addition to my initial review.1. The phone battery drains fast compared to the capacity and it hardly lasts a day2. The bokeh effect is not something worthy, lot of manual stabilization and patience is required to get a good shot3. heating problem continues and it seems a permanent issue4. Poor OS optimization and thus not suitable for heavy gaming, plus the heating issue5. Works fine with Jio VoLTE, both for calls and dataVerdict: Hype is not delivered."
1418,0,Good
1419,1,It is super
1420,0,This phone has heating issue in only 10 days from purchase date.

1422,0,I have never been believed Lenovo not gonna do so.It is the worst experience ever in my life with a new phone.Lenovo is fake company.Battery doesn't even last 10 with easy usage .Graphics is not good as adreno.so totally it's a worst phone

1430,1,Excellent performance. Quite happy with the product. Battery lasts for more than 24 hours inspite of heavy usage. Camera performance is also very good. All you have to do is adjust some settings in the camera app. No lag no hang so far. Screen resolution is beautiful. Writing this review after using the phone for more than a month now. Go for it guys.
1431,0,really hate this
1432,0,IT COMES WITH GORILLA GLASS WHICH CAN BREAK ESASYLY. even in low pressure on it.

1434,1,Very good product. Nice smooth performance. Thanks mediatek for high speed processor. Those who ever wants can buy with out hesitation.
1435,0,Phone good with good features but not having a headphone with it is the biggest turn-offs. That just seems CHEAP on Lenovo's part not to add in the headphones. The FM application is useless without the headphones.

1502,0,"Dear Amazon / Lenovo,I purchased this phone as a gift for my father who is 70+ yrs hoping that the large screen and its ease of operation would help him. Right from the start after receipt of the phone my father kept complaining that there is a problem with the phone as screen does not respond / wake up (if locked) or notify an incoming call; so he is only able to hear phone ring but not able to receive the call. I thought it was a settings issue but when we took to Lenovo service center at Prime Mall, Irla, Vile Parle (w), Mumbai on 18 Oct 2017 the service Center representative said that we should have returned the product in 15-days and then took in phone for software reload. My father spent Rs 700 for backing up & reloading data. After this software reload the product worked ok until 27 Oct 2017 and then the same incoming call issue has reoccurred.Now my father who is 70+ yrs old is sick of this phone and this problem and doesn’t want it.Kindly assist in the matter please."
1503,1,I received phone quickly & short time... Good work..
1504,0,Camera awesome. Touch perfomance good.sound quality is best. But where is defaut Gallery? Where is clipboard? Where is defaut music player? Too Weight(190gram).
1505,0,"This product doesn't meet all the expectations it created at the time of launching.1. Processor and Camera is good. No buffering while watching videos in you tube / live tv / dedicated portals of TV network.2. Trendy look, easy handling and lenovo could have provided headsets in the accessory kit. That was missing!!!!3. Turbo Charging was good initially after couple of months it started deteriorating from its set standards. It takes time min of 1.30 hrs for 20% when the battery capacity is at 80%.4. Battery life is not as expected for 4000 mAH. For a non gamer with limited default apps it should last for more than a day when used fully under mobile data. But battery drains out quickly.5. Ear piece volume: there is a problem in all lenevo mobiles that, while on call near by person can hear the voice of other person. Its very pathetic when it comes to whatsapp calling. It gives us a feel, like we put our mobiles on speakers. The volume is too loud even though the same is kept at least level. Lenovo technical team should pay more attention on this set back.6. Audio Output : Could feel dolby atmos effect only when we keep our palm near speakers. Else this feel is missing completely. Its because of single outgo at the bottom of the device due to which this feature got misfired i believe. Tested this feature specifically with dolby atmos effect videos which is widely available in web pages.7. Otherwise, got this mobile on deal. So when compared with other models i got the device for what i have paid for. i should compromise myself in that way.8. Could feel heating issues when mobile data is used continuously for more than 25 minutes or during on a call for more than 15 minutes.Hope this review helps."

1538,1,Good product
1539,1,Phone is good but don't by now as there r more options.Battery drains like Micromax which is not expected in Lenovo perhaps the high end display has resulted this.if ur darling is ur smartphone then I m sorry to say she can run for only 6 hours continuously.so think wisly n heartly before taking this.There is no problem of overheating.Dual app settings is not available a big disappointment if u use that. There r no head phones with u have to buy that urself
1540,0,"Worest phone in world, battery drains quickly,volte not working properly,if on battery saver from prevent battery,volte not working, fingerprint scanner is very slow,bad camera quality.i want returned this phone but I got bad response from Amazon,so don't buy this phone"

1545,0,"Got this phone delivered today and I was not completely impressed by it.The pros:Absolute fine display.Good camera quality.Great finishing to the body work.Comes with transparent body cover.Dual SIM and Micro SD can be used altogether.Charge speed/Power backup is best in class.The cons:No earphones.Has Dolby Atmos but no Audiophile sound. (Not as loud and clear as K4 Note and Vibe X3 with earphones). Not suited for music enthusiasts at all.Stock Android 7.1 version is rugged and not so user friendly. Too many settings are replaced and are annoying to navigate through.Overall, a decent phone at great price considering the hardware package being offered."
1546,0,1) I bought this for dual camera but the deep effect was not not good.2) battery life awesome

1553,0,"I purchased this mobile at republic day sale. As always they reduced mobile prices and sold it. The beauty is, those mobiles should have any defect like heating, Bluetooth problems. So now you can understand why they give extra discount on this mobile.

1570,1,Awesome phone in best price
1571,1,It's a really good device in this price. Dedicated micro SD slot is a big plus. The heating issues are blown out of proportion. It heats like any other phone on high usage.

1598,0,My Experience was very bad when I used Lenovo K8 Note. I think it was one of the worst product I ever use. There are so many issues with this product. The battery backup is mazor issue. On the box it has 4000 MAH Battery . But it was drained maximum 5 - 6 Hours in normal condition. Its annoying . The phone has two big issues also - 1. Heating Issue 2. Hang issues. Only the phone camera is good. It is the worst smartphone I ever use. I dont want use this product kindly return it and give my money back.

Its battery back up is poor and video quality doesn't match with the same end phones.I want to suggest buyers who are planning to buy this phone don't buy this ,, instead of K8 Note go for K8 plus ..K8 plus and k8 note has small difference in specs but very big differences in performance. K8 plus has good battery life and last for almost 1 day after heavy use (in my case)., k8 note has same 4k mah battery but drains very quickly.Gaming experience quite nice on k8 plus and k8 note both..No lags. K8 NOTE has some heating issue while charging but k8 plus has very minor or no heating problems.I have both the phones and among both of them k8 plus seems good to me.Thank u."
1616,1,A real great phone. Fully developed Lenovo technology. Good to buy this.
1617,0,Dual camera is not working any way good amazon services is good
1618,0,Looks and works good.But consumes lot of bactory.Need to charge twice a day.
1619,1,I saw 2 problems in mobile. 1) I found no gallery in mobile 2) it takes too much time to delete pics from file manager. Rest Lenovo k8 note is wonderful

1624,1,Battery quality and back up is really awesome.Camera quality is also good.Screen resolution is attractive.Buttons are a bit hard but fine enoughSpeaker quality is above par.Really nice buy option among budget phones.
1625,1,Best mobile in this price
1626,0,Am not get 15%off discount...
1627,0,The phone hangs and restarts...apparently it is something to do with the software update... Quite ridiculous because one would expect the phone to perform better with an update when the memory is half unused and that there are not many applications
1628,1,"Awesome mobile at this price, good battery backup, super camera clarity & flash on both front & back, huge memory (64GB inbuilt & 4GB ram) & also dedicated memory card slot, dual SIM, every thing is good. But tempered glass is not fit for the curved finish display, so can be rated 4."
1629,1,"Everything thing is perfect but it is having 2 major problems,1. Secondary camera and Boke effect is zero performance, it's nothing there just a marketing strategy.2.Bluetooth is not working properly, getting struck while playing audio through Bluetooth and even when we switch the Bluetooth on it won't connect fast it will tries to connect all other devices which are not in range(have connected in past) if we click on particular Bluetooth device also it won't responds correctly.Plz try to rectify it..Otherwise it's a very good product for this price.!"
1630,0,"Nothing to go awww with the specs, neither the phone is dud.Music & Camera- Nothing exciting, Music is strictly Ok, Camera is decent.Software- Few glitches in the software, we cant see the battery percentage, no provision for night eye care view. (K6 Note had)Gaming- Avoid if you are a gamer and like to play for 2-3 hrs daily. Phone gets heat up above 40 degrees. Also, I saw lags in phone while playing basic games.Speed- If multiple applications are runned, than there is chance that phone will get slightly slow.Display- Superb, at this price tag.Overall review- Nice phone, but could have been way better had Lenovo used SD625 chipset, they should not had compromised on chipset.Still, not a bad purchase,, just get your priority right.Update- Please don't buy this device that is my humble request to all"
1631,1,value for money.Good product.
1632,0,The in-box accessories had earphone missing in it. Nice way to cheat 1000 rs from customers. Never expected this. Worst.

1637,1,Happy
1638,0,I'm writing this review after using the mobile for 1 month. B4 this phone I have uSed K3Note that was far better in performance than this mobile. It's worth buy if you get it below 10K. Not recommended for 12K+.
1639,0,Very bad
1640,1,Excellent
1641,0,"This mobile is same as other mobile. This mobile having hanging problem, and it is heating like a cooker while I turn ON the wifi or mobile data. And the camera quality is not as much good. Nothing Special. Disappointed the expectations"
1642,0,Worst phone I never seen this type of phone. If I use this phone continuous 15 minutes getting heat. Battery capacity mentioned was 4000 mah but its value is 1000 mah. Worst battery backup. No Default music application and no Default gallery application. I recommended you people don't purchase. If we go service center no proper response from those guys.
1643,1,"Nice and This feature are already in the Moto. But in this less gesture, but ok"
1644,1,Best mobile at this price.No complaints.I don't want to go to technical side.But as for pure mobile user it is best.

1661,1,"Best mobile ever , best performance of camera processor also very fast and battery performance also good"
1662,0,RIDICULOUS Phone. Absolute terrible that amazon sells this heat pad as a phone. it heats up first time you charge it. has a billion bugs. so disappointed had to sell mine immediately after buying. deca core but still lags. network issues. Jio sim issues. heavy at 180 grms. cant get over the bad experience i had. please save yourself the trouble and dont buy it.
1663,0,I am using this phone over a 3month and I am facing to much of problems like1 worst battery backup2 loss of so many features3 if u had a brain better don't buy this product
1664,0,Very poor battery!!! Does not even last for a full day on normal usage. The 4000mah battery on the Redmi 4 lasts for two days almost with normal usage. This phone is definitely not comparable to the Redmi 4. This is no 'killer' note. The supposed to be fast/turbo charger is a normal charger. Takes over 3 hours to charge the battery from 15 to 100%. Disappointed totally
1665,1,Nice phone
1666,0,Worst phone 😡

1674,0,Previously I had Oppo F1S that ran games smoothly and it had 3 GB of RAM. This K8 Note has 4 GB of RAM but games like (War Robots) is lagging in this phone. I feel very bad for buying this phone. WORST
1675,0,AFTER INSTALLATION OF RECENT UPDATE THE PHONE IS HEATING UP VERY FAST AND THE BATTERY GOES DOWN IN A JIFFY FROM 100 TO 0 I THINK THE UPDATE IS FAULTY SAME PROBLEM IS SEEN IN ALL K8 NOTES
1676,1,Nice phone
1677,0,There is no headphones with the device and no option to use a customized ringtone. You have to use the pathetic and irritating ringtones and alarm from this device. very very disappointing.
1678,1,Great battery great performance and front flashlight was cool...but it depth camera not work properly...
1679,1,Nice phone
1680,0,"Lenovo K8 Note (Venom Black, 4GB)I am very upset when I face network related issue in this handset, I generally use idea!

1683,0,"DON'T BUY K8. SOFTWARE BUGS.This is my 1st negative feedback. There are issues with notifications. Contacted Tech Support team to whom even making the problem understood is a Herculean task.. so you can forget about resolution. Only answer available is ""escalating, team work, shall revert at earliest"". Hope we all know what such responses mean. I AM DISGUSTED WITH LENOVO. They claimed K8 to be killer..Yes it would kill your want to use smartphone !!!Don't waste your time and money on a half cooked phone released in hurry to counter Nokia.I repent buying it and thought it prudent to warn the fraternity of potential buyers.Rajiv Pathakrajivpathak27@gmail.com"
1684,1,Nice and Excellent working on it.
1685,1,It's an amazing product at this price. The only thing I found lacking is the internet connectivity and the battery back up. Though it claims to have 4000 mAh back up but with frequest browsing and talking it gets exhausted very fast. There is no lagging the phone responds to your type request very fast and the Google assistant is saviour. Over all a good phone to go ahead with.
1686,1,"There was only one Charger in the box, where as they mentioned dual chargers of 15w."

1729,1,"Gud Mobile except the earphone socket, which is not remarkable. Overall gud but not too gud."
1730,0,I bought this product from a flash sale on Amazon in August 2018. It's been just 7 months and this 13999 mobile with 4gb ram behaving like some cheap product it switch off automatically 8-10 times a day. Twice I have been to the service center but the problem persist. They say it's ok now and I face the same problem the very same day. Now I m trying to get it exchange with any other phone and I m getting 2700 offer from Amazon. Wow
1731,0,Not good product. Only battery is good. Bluetooth is very bad
1732,0,"This phone doesnt feel like a 4000mah phone. Even my lenovo vibe k5 note gave better backup than k8 note.The ram doesnt feel like a 4gb ram either. Even when you dont have any apps running, the ram usage is high.Price wise this is decent. But there the specs on paper and the performance dont match up with each other.Unless lenovo optimise the performance and send in an update, my recommendation would be ""Dont Buy"""

1783,0,I can't expect Lenovo to produce a product like garbage. Lenovo K8 note is just worst phone so far. K4 note was much better in design and performance which I used last before K8. Network issue is one and Hotspot issue is second big problem. I am unable to find network even sometimes at open places. And Hotspot do not work when you want to connect it with Laptop.So be careful is you are considering this handset.Also rear camera is garbage.Hell.

To replace, i have to shell out about 5k. I haven't expected this from the so called Gorilla Glass. It is not Gorilla glass 3 gen and hence be careful. It is not meant for even little rough use."

1893,1,Awesome performer Smartphone till date
1894,0,"I bought it in August. And within 2 months, I had to rush to the service center to get the battery checked. Thank God, it was still in warranty period. After an update, battery started to drain profusely. Suddenly, it was taking 4-10 HOURS to get fully charged. It wasn't so before. The service center people say they'll call you once they fix your phone, trust me, they don't. The phone was okay for a while. The charger had a problem.Then again, while charging the phone, I was using it. Maybe for once. And Bam! The charger got damaged. I had used HTC before and used it while charging. Nothing ever happened. -_-Again I rushed. They charged some amount to get the charger cord fixed. Now it's working fine.Problems:1. It heats a lot. Can't use it without cover. Your hands will feel really warm if you don't.2. Can't send messages from Jio. Imagine!3. It's Volte. But on the status bar, it says LTE. Stupid.4. Very heavy. Heavier when you use tempered glass to protect the screen. And you won't get right kind of glass for the curved edges. Hence, though the screen looks really premium, you have to use a flat tempered glass with no curved edges. It ruins the actual look.5. Be prepared to be amazed if you didn't know stock Android phones don't have gallery (other than Google photos), no option for including ringtones, no theme, hardly any variety in the wallpapers and no customization."

With lot of expectations went for the phone.1)one of the worst phone i have ever used, very poor network signal. I was getting full signal on Airtel but on K8 I am hardly getting 2 bars. SIGNAL IS VERY VERY WEAK WHEN COMPARED TO OTHER MOBILES.2)In the name of MEDIATEK HELIO X23 processor they have used old MEDIATEK HELIO X20 processor!!!3)Heating issue, the phone heats even after 5 mins of playing a game or using camera. It's back panel always feels warm and after few minutes of usage I cant even make call because it gets too hot for my ear to bear. we can't perform the most basic function of calling ( without feeling the heat), browsing etc. The device always feels warm in your hand and a simple 10 mins of browsing and then you cant hold it against your ear to make a call,yes, it gets this hot.4)Battery drains very fast, even when the phone is idle.5)The web support of Lenovo is also of no use. I made the mistake of buying this phone, all of you out there please dont make my mistake6)Notification led issues. I installed speed test and the Network speed is terriblly slow!!!.7)incorrect specification ""Dual nano SIM with dual-standby (4G+4G)"". In reality this phone support 4G+3G only like other phones.8)Signal strength is a huge pain. Sometimes calls drop unexpectedly. Amazon is not exchanging the product... poor network strength.I am going to make all my friends aware of the new amazon's return policy. Less in features not worth of money and expectations9)call recorder not working"
1973,1,Nice and Very Good Model
1974,0,1 star
1975,0,"I am giving one star as 1/2 star is not available.bad phone with above average camera.Frequent restarts. Heating, battery drainage.Not user friendly. K4 note is much better. Already asked for return and refund.Don't buy k8 note"
1976,1,Very good

1980,0,Second sim not working and mirror cast also not working worts phone from Lenovo company
1981,1,Nice mobile
1982,1,Very poor quality
1983,0,Getting hot from backCharger is not so fast take around 2 hour to full charge
1984,1,Greate features at reasonable prize
1985,1,Good Mobile best one
1986,0,This phone is not good bcz heating problem is more. Its not good... How is solve?
1987,1,I want to reutrn my phone
1988,1,"No doubt, it's a great phone & fast charging really works."
1989,1,"Lenovo K8 note for great front camera, good rear camera(bokeh effect is good only in well lit conditions), very good performance, better battery...."
1990,0,Camera is great both front and rear similar to v5plus and oppo selfie. But Only Android version is there. No user interface. So no customization option. I say no. You can't even change ringtone nd no Applocker inbuilt.
1991,0,Pathetic mobile. No sound getting hang after updating to oreo 8
1992,0,When it was new it worked well but now after 2 months it horrible camera doesn't open many apps crashDepth mode is not working properlyI have visited the service centre got temporary solution but then again same issue
1993,0,Trying to call also phone is getting hanged. Just 1 month old mobile. Don't go with lenovo k8 note.
1994,0,Worst product!! Amazon doesn't even refund easily even though mobile is not working properly. Worst experience ever with manufacturer as well as seller.
1995,0,"The features are excellent but the usability isn't there. Despite a 10-core processor, 4 GB of RAM, it hangs out quite frequently. I have an old Huawei Honor 6, 3 GB RAM - 2015 model, which is better than the new device. Also applications keeps on crashing quite frequently.Camera is of not good use too. The pixel clarity is inefficient as it gets blur upon zooming (after clicking of photographs). Also the time taken for saving the picture is +3 seconds after the click, which is quite high as I have never used such a slow camera in any phone.Battery life is good. With constant data, frequent calling and mail checks, it runs for 8-10 hrs. Also turbo charger is a great advantage.Speakers are another strong point in the phone. The sounds are great, means comparable or better than my Vaio Laptop.The phone boosts of Gorilla Glass, but got scratch within a week of use while keeping it in pocket only.Lenovo doesn't have any Gallery or Music Player apps, so had to download it from google play, which again either comes with advertisements or I need to purchase those. Hence, I am stuck with the advertised versions of basic apps. Also, had purchased New System Updates, still had to update 2 GB of updates in total 3 times. Still Oreo update would be available only in June/July.The worst part is I had gifted it to my wife, and now what I got in return is the complaints part, that too all the time. Means despite spending 10k approx., this device does not fulfil its advertised words."
1996,0,FULL HAD VEDIO NOT PLAYING PROPERLY AND ALSO SOUNF BREAK WHEN CONNECTED TO BLUETOOTH.NOT PREPARED TO PURCHASE.
1997,0,Worst phone ever purchased
1998,1,Best mobile with excellent features and performance........Turbo charging is one of the best features.
1999,0,What the hell is this I buy a lenova k8 note before 2mnth now this condition is very worst charge dry very fast and charging is very slow and heat over produced very very worst mobile
2000,1,Very cool phone. Easy to handle with almost complete features and specification.
2001,1,Awesome
2002,0,"I don't find this phone worth.the phone does not work as lenovo claimed. They used dual in depth camera, turbo charger as a gimmick. should go for honor 6x for best alternative for this phone.RAM Management: processor and ram management is very good. the phone does not lag.Camera: an Awful camera. don't know why its camera app decreases the quality of the image.The camera will really let you down.Charging: It takes around 2 hours and 30 mins to charge completely from 15% which is a lot if the company claims for turbo charger.Phone size & weight: There is some extra space at top and bottom which ruins phone handling experience.Sock Android: It is the only thing which is good.Network issue: after switching my sims to this phone having the issue of the phone going not reachable."
2003,1,camera was not clear
2004,0,Ghatiya productBattery bahut jaldi discharge ho rhi. Phone heat karta h . lenovo ne ye kya product nikala hAur amazon ke customer care executive wo aur mahanAmazon se kuch kharidna hi nahi chaiye
2005,1,Good not better
2006,0,"Please refrain from getting cheated by buying this phone. In the form of a stock Android OS, this phone has regressed a great deal from the previous k series phones. It does not have many important features like long screenshot etc and screen casting/mirroring is only possible if you buy Chromecast device separately. The menus have changed from the previous version and are very user unfriendly. Lenovo has taken a big step in alienating loyal customers by releasing this substandard phone to our markets and I caution all potential buyers to beware or end up feeling cheated like I am."
2007,1,"K8 note satisfied when compared to same range mobiles in market ,slightly dissatisfied with cam quality rest all okPros- good Battery capacity 4000mah,dual rear cameras,Cons- non removable battery and weights about 180 gms little heavier."
2008,0,"This phone is not truly dual sim 4G...and after updating it with android 8 it is totally wastage of money.heating problem ,Slow charging, Digital Dolby sound is gone, Mobile data tab is not working, battery backup is very poorDr.V.singh"
2009,1,good
2010,1,Good
2011,0,"This phone after getting the Oreo update, is completely useless. It gets heated like a pan. You can literally cook dosa on the phone. Lags like snail. Turbo charge takes 7 hours to charge. When contacted the lenovo customer care about the issue, they are even clueless of the issue and asking me to wait for official update from Lenovo, which they are also not sure when it will be released. If you buy the phone, dont damn update the phone with new software. Use it with the Stock OS, Android Nougat 7.x version."
2012,0,Battery life is crap rest is OK
2013,1,"Good product, could have been better."
2014,1,Very good phone. In both of two camera front camera also Awesome but rear camera can take photo with blur. Sound quality also good with dolby atmos. Music key works good. Ovearl in this price range lenovo k8 note is a good performance phone. I love my phone
2015,1,Good mobile
2016,0,Bad product
2017,1,Excellent..I have been using it for a long time now.. simply amazing.. battery is good..camera is fine too..overall pretty satisfying at this price
2018,0,Screen mirroring option is not availableSpeakers quality is not goodCamrea result bad
2019,0,Camera is very very very poor don't trust this it's say 13mg pixel but pics are very poor in quality when u zoom into a pic the photo gets blurred it's not up to the mark . My opinion out of 10 I give 2 rank ..for camera ..over all performance is gud but camera is very bad not even expected of such a low quality camera
2020,1,nice product
2021,0,Nice mobile good touch nice look good performance the only one thing is battery drain is fast after 4010 Mah...
2022,0,Third class mobile..do no buy
2023,1,Nice
2024,1,Price worth Mobile.
2025,0,"Ordered this phone for my Wife after buying Lenovo K6 Power . Design is good, but Speaker sound surprisingly disappointing no where near to K6 power. Came to know that turbo charger is not actually a fast charger (Boom ! another surprise). Verified Camera and its nothing great compared to the way it is marketed. Overall, feeling little disappointed considering i was expecting it better than K6 power.Recommendation: Nothing Great, you can skip this one and wait for MI Pro 2 or more reviews of Moto G5 Plus."
2026,1,Nice phone ..i was using this phone more than three weeks...There is no issue still i found..
2027,1,It is better then my expectations...
2028,0,"I have brought this product in oct 2017 , but from six month i am facing the heat issue in charging and calling . From 2 month managing to work with this,but its become worst condition now. Phone is in warrently, anyway to exchange this product"
2029,1,Value for money
2030,0,Not good
2031,1,"Nice piece, though very crudely packed. Timely delivered..."
2032,0,"Faulty piece received. Facing Problem in touch screen. Keypad operating automatically. Apps, call history, dialling pads etc opening itself even not touching to the handset. Bad experience of purchasing through Amazon."
2033,0,Worst phone ever. Never going to buy Lenovo products ever. Brought this phone 2 months ago and I was quite happy with the performance initially. But yesterday it was just fell off the bed and the display cracked. It cost me 5.2k for new display. So overall I had paid 20k for this phone which I don't think it worth.but I had no option. Suggest everyone to stay away from Lenovo products. Lenovo may offers you high configuration phones @ reasonable rates but believe me guys their maintenance is way expensive. God bless Lenovo consumers. Good luck.
2034,1,Awesome ....😘😘😘
2035,1,Good
2036,0,Not a good phone it's not even been 1month completed there a damage with the phone phone is getting over heated I want the phone back and neither I will pay the amount I took it for EMI

2039,1,Awesome
2040,1,The product is too good but the new update with Oreo is very bad that's why given 4 stars. Overall phone is too good. I have used till 8 months and have been great till now.

2043,1,Good phone
2044,0,Product is good
2045,0,Battery problem
2046,1,I purchase this phone after many researches.camera is best at this price point.battery FHD display is good.almost everything is fine.but some cons. Are there also.usable memory is less than half of 32gb.phone takes a lot of time to start.except this the phone is best and really a killer note.
2047,0,Turbo charging taking 6hours to get full charge while device is on and taking 3hours to get full charge while device is switched off then after battery is draining like anything. Im not a heavy user but this phone's battery draining in just 20hours.I feel im wasted my money on this device.Im not going to trust lenovo anymore n moreover ill spared my experience and discourage my folks towards lenovo products.
2048,1,Nice phone k8
2049,1,"This is an really faster than snapdragon 625.Every app opens fast.But the Bokeh effect is very poor.very bad bokeh effect., Selfie camera best"
2050,1,Great
2051,1,very nice mobile..
2052,0,Battery back up not good....
2053,0,Very poor handset please take it back
2054,0,Phone overheats way too quick. 4000 mAh battery barely stays 2-3 of gaming. I used Redmi note 5 pro before this. Same 4000 mAh battery but Note 5 can handle 5-6 hours of gaming easily. Lastly turbo charging is joke; 10% - 100% in 2 hours 30 mins most of the time.
2055,1,"Sometimes getting heat , remaining everything good"
2056,1,Good product but bokeh effect not works well. Otherwise acceptable.

2063,0,verry bad
2064,0,Not able to open gallery
2065,0,After 5 days of usage turbocharging stopped working..Now it takes about 6 to 7 hrs to get fully charged... Camera is normal not so good.totally disappointed after 6 days of usage ...
2066,1,Worth product
2067,0,This phone is quite fast. It's finger sensor is useless when ever I try to use the finger sensor it says lens is dirty who will clean the sensor before every use or who will wash hands regularly before every use. One more point I could not find tempered glass screen protector for this phone I tried two screens but they broke after few days of use. I ordered one from amazon but that one did not fit properly on tis phone and broke within few days.
2068,1,Nice
2069,0,Worked only a day then it collapsed automatically
2070,0,"Disappointed me. Some basic features are skipped. Yellow light, call recorder not working, call log difficult to delete call from list, makes difficult to operate smoothly....Made me sad"

Very very very bad....i should have bought redmi note 5 pro.....i regret now...... Phone's performance is not up to the mark.....very slow sometimes.....4 gb ram and decacore processor is just good in papers...... Heating is like volcano.......i fear when it might explode .... That's the heating when playing games and heavy duty stuffs.....i am not at all satisfied...... Lenovo should come with more future sofware updates for battery backup and performance......else it will be a disaster phone

2099,1,Best phone ever at this price
2100,1,Overall good product. But I didn't like camera quality and dual camera background blur is not good at all. The amount of blur it produces is not acceptable. Battery backup is good. little heavy in weight. Curve edges of screen interferes with touch capabilities of device when holding.

Its not acceptable for new phone like lenovo. otherwise all other features, Camera, overall performance is too good. Look wise also its nice.

2262,0,"Dont buy... Heavy battery draining issue, even when it is in idle"
2263,0,Bluetooth connection issues. Pairing issues with everything.Lenovo customer care openly admitting there is issue in phone.Now I am stuck with it; can return also. This kind of software issues should be deemed as a defective product by Amazon.

If someone calls it says out of reach , or I would have rate it 3 and half stars2. Battery backup is not what I expected,not worthy for a 4000 MAh3. Camera quality is also below average.4. Performance is very nice and smooth.5. Sound quality is very nice and loud in speaker but lil less sound with super quality in earphones .6. Looks is awesome ."

2284,1,It is good budget phone and also working goodCamera of phone is awesome
2285,0,"This phone, is not able to connect Bluetooth properly it takes 4 to 5 times but audio breaks for some time and some time it connects well. Next thing is audio port for headphones, is a complete failure, it always moves and disconnects. Actually, I thought of going to take my phone to Lenovo service center. Where as the previous phone which I used was perfect over these, aspects. Dual camera is of no effect. Dolby Atmos is incredible, for this reason only I bought this phone, gorilla glass is No.1, touch, and finger print sensor is awesome. 4GB Ram rocks, in speed."

2306,1,Nice Handset
2307,1,I have been using this phone for a week now and it is perfectly fine. The performance for normal apps is best. I am not a gaming guy but the other business apps work best. No lag no heating issue. Charges fast. Camera is ok. Sounds are awesome with normal earphones also.
2308,1,Good bt not as expected
2309,1,It's gud speed processing
2310,0,"I have been using this product since 20th August and its been good but not in par with the contenders like Redmi note 4 or the recently launched Moto G5s plus. But to be frank its a good phone in its way, The design is a choice of preference I like it but you may not so its matter of preference and don't forget to get a case its a slippery device. It's a bit on heavy side but its not a big deal. The display is good but I wish it could be more brighter. The built-in speaker is good,its loud and crisp(for the price), the Dolby Atmos is a gimmick I don't see much improvement when turned on or off but still its there if you want. But the built-in DAC for the headphones is on a bit of lower side I don't see it as a good one, Audiophiles stay away from this. Coming to the camera(s) they are OK but there is a need of improvement. The primary camera(13mp) is good for outdoor shots but in indoors its worse you need to go for other option if indoor is your preference, Flash can light up but you trade in for noise and you have a depth effect which uses the second sensor(5mp) at he back to add a bokeh effect and its in need for a huge improvement the edges of the subject is soft and to find the focus you will have a hard time. The video quality is good if you have enough light but there is no image stabilization so you need to have steady hands and it tops out only at 1080p at 30fps while the processor can handle 4k. The front facing camera(13mp) is good though if you are in need it has a dedicated selfie flash and it works. The battery backup is also good i get nearly 4-5 hrs of screen on time but it depends because the MTK processor in this is not that efficient but you get rapid charging which charges the phone from 0-100% in about one and half hour to two hours. The software is similar to what we get in moto devices(since moto makes these devices) so you can expect pure build of android with 7.1.1 Nougat. But I haven't seen any security updates and its on July month's patch. The performance is good for the price you are paying, I think memory management is a bit on aggressive side but its OK you can't expect much from a mid ranger. I will update the review once it is update to Android O."
2311,1,Good till now.
2312,0,Bad than 10.or G
2313,0,There is no screen shot option.and your service center service is poor in Indore there is no gallery

2322,1,"It can beat any phone both within same range, cost and beyond it's cost. A phone costs about 20K also can't compete with this phone. No Heating issue, extreme speed of processing, a sexy look from front side oval type glass, Hillarious sound with it's dolby atmos speaker, full water & scratch proof, the best part is the back duak camera with which you can record video in slow motion mode & can take picture in depth mode and then can edit those pictures in depth mode also. Believe me.....it's simply the best among all smart phone in it's rang & beyond it's range also."
2323,0,I bought Lenovo K8 Note one month back and Lenovo make me to think why I choose Lenovo it is just one month cell with lot of problem and no proper service or feedback from customer care main problem is battery issue in just 3 hours my battery goes from 100% to 60% and I try to reach customer care but no use no proper service very worst better before buying pls think twice...

2452,0,Worst product please don't buy and frequently switch off
2453,1,I am using this device from 2 days. And still i can't found any type of defect from lenovo k8 note. This note is really killer then other notes at this price. Both cameras are really killer. And the display is awsome. Its decacore processer is working very nice then snapdragon. The device is slim & grippy. Battry life is good. All over i can say that according to lenovo this device is really killer #killer note ever.

2575,0,"Not fully satisfied with the product due to network connection issue - Bluetooth and wifi and heating issue. Seems faulty product - Lenovo k8 Note.Bluetooth paring successfully done with wireless speaker and car's music system however the music/voice quality is not good. Music playback is neither continuous nor smooth via bluetooth, too much interval while calling though bluetooth. Screen mirroring is not possible with TV as mobile devise is unable to find the available cast screen devises(TV).Even after updating OTA update the problem still unresolved.Lenovo should rectify the issues.Turbo charger is very sluggish and took 2 hours to full charge the devise (if not used, while using it took 5-6 hours to charged fully).However the mobile looks good and rest of the feature works fine like display, calling quality, camera, touch, etc.Camera is good despite of negative review by leading technical reviewer ""phone me koi khas dam to he nai"", ""Lenovo mamu bana raha he"" etc. camera works fine as single camera, as well as in depth enable mode. camera performance is good and justify the mobile price range. (don't misguide by opinions of tech reviewer).I used Lenovo K4 Note for 18 months, and satisfied with the phone, so purchase 2 K5 note for my dad and sister and both devises works fine without any issues. I purchase k8 note but not satisfied with the product."

2705,0,Good working
2706,0,Mobile is overheating cant kept in pocket
2707,0,"Been using it since 2days.What you get for 13k am gonna share,sincei got the 32gb/3gb variant which is enough for my usage.Looks are good sleek and slim not wide like redmi note 3/4.Venom black is good quite contrasting. can't say about other variant.Battery is moderate for 4000mah you have to charge twice if your heavy user. Yes turbo charging does work.But standby could have been better. As you have got power you gotta compromise somewhere. if it could have paired with SD 625 battery would have been promising but can't do anything now.Hardware aspect now,10 core power yes you do feel if your SD 625 user,as I was i felt it faster.Only issue i would like lenovo to improve it ram optimisation,i know it need software update or something for betterment in this aspect,i only hope lenovo delivers it fast enough because with usual 50 apps installed you will get 50-60% utelisation,in SD 625 it was somewhat lower to 45-50%. Rest you won't feel any lag or something,it just need an software update.Now focus point of these smartphone,cameras. Lets talk about the front 1st,its decent enough for selfie but not meant for poor lighting condition. in good light you will get good pics.Now Rear,13+5 normal camera works good. Also during in depth which means both lenses will be active you get some shot like slr,good innovation for budget phone but same like ram it need software updates for optimum utelisation.i love stock android,and i loved this was of stock android,though i did miss the menu button no issue its just fine replacement.I would say,for the price segment the pros are too good to let you buy one. So go for it.only issues or cons are with software,lets hope lenevo releases new patches frequently taking in mind of the users and reveiwers.And Yes Corning + 2.5D glass works like charm. kuddos lenovo.Thanks.p.s-hope lenovo checks the reviewers,to improve their product....UPDATE:AFTER 20DAYSFacing a severe issue,while kept phone for idle about 1hr or more everything works fine just,text messages you send are not being delivered,again you have to power off and turn on for it to deliver. Why the heck is that?Also the last patch update was on JULY 5TH 2017,Please kindly deliver a update soon. Today is 10sept 2017 more than 2months have passed. Kindly fix.This made me think about my choice i made on lenovo."

2726,0,"This product is very bad. Please dont fall for high specs and compare it with redme note 4 or any other phones at this price range. It is having lot of heating issues even for normal usage. I have been using redme note 3 from more than a year but never faced hanging issues in chrome browser. With k8 note the browser hanged, battery drained very fast and some of the calls got dropped.By seeing at that high specification, I though this could be very good deal but this is very much disappointing. Please go for the brand which is very much trusted and having a lot of positive reviews.I request Amazon to kindly consider my request for return and refund the amount. Flipkarts return policy is much better and easy to operate."

The warranty did not cover the same. Was terribly disappointed with lenovo.

2935,0,Hai I bought a new levono k8 note. The levono system is upgraded the battery charging very slow .Why ? What's happening? What's the solution
2936,1,Battery backup is not goodOverall performance is good
2937,1,Worth for your money
2938,1,"Overall phone does well. RAM and ROM are extraordinary. Battery backup and Rapid charging is Very Good. Especially rear and front camera is superb..But when I connect it to any speakers via Bluetooth, it's very irritating. Totally disappointed in this matter. I hope that manufacturer can fix this problem in the next system update. When I listen the music via Bluetooth speakers it interrupts very much. But Lenovo K6 Power works very well when compared to K8 Note."
2939,1,Perfect phone
2940,1,"Here is a true review after 10 days of use,Cast screen is not working,or some good fetures like many lights indicator,data speed indicator in notification is not available like older version of lenovo notes..Some fetures is degrade instead of upgradeFront flash light is good but no results of dual cameras..But in this price this phone is very good"

2942,1,Good phone. Battery is only prob..
2943,1,Nice product. Loved it.The only thing which bothers is no inbuilt call recorder. But we can definitely go for third party apps for that.
2944,1,The product recieved as it was described. Nice phone in this price range.....
2945,0,"Overall product is good but in headset audio output is very low /poor even ordinary phone of 2-3 k range has this much output ,may be it is manufacturing defect as I used Lenovo K4 & 5 and found audio quality very good of these edition and for same reason and experience I ordered K8 Note asked Amazon for a replacement let's hope to get something positive in replaced handset . Hope Amazon will help me get a replaced one ..Will update full review and rating only after receiving replacement ...."
2946,1,Very good phone
2947,0,"I got the phone yesterday evening only and i am very disappointed with the product. Lenovo is such a brand and coming up with this type of phone will degrade its reputation. I bought this phone because i previously used K3 note.Following are its cons:-1) Camera is very bad, i captured a couple of pics in night mode and day mode there are really very bad with regards to clarity.2) They say its Turbo Charging but the charging is no that speedy it gets fully charged at 6hrs 30 mints. Please suggest me how can it be called Turbo charger if its so slow.3) The look is not that nice and attractive.4) It gets heat very fast.5) The battery also drains very fast and with in no time it comes to 50%.6) Sound quality they say its Dolby but no where it is near to it.I would really avoid purchasing this phone instead go for Oneplus 5 or Samsung J7. or C7."

2965,0,"have been a Lenovo fan , but this K8 note is not a great phone in terms of comfort of handling....It is very slippery and does not fit into our hands...Screen replacement costs Rs.5500/- for a phone of 14k.... Battery life is better but not as per the claims...UI is good.. bought this for me and redmi note 4for my wife....looks redmi note4 scores hands down"
2966,0,I m purchase this phone.phone looking best but 1. Two sim+ memory don't use .2.you use only 15 minute phone are HOT..3.sound quality not satisfaction.... Overall phone r very bed phone..........
2967,0,"I feel cheated by lenovo.please dont buy this phone.it may have a good hardware, but stock android provided with K8 is just intolerable.let me just jot down few of the many reasons1. No inbuilt call recording facility.2. No scheduled power on/off option.3. No gallery, u have to use google's photo app instead.4. it takes a long time to show a flashy lenovo animation, which is truly a waste if time for me. u need to root ur phone to change it.5. the call log stores only last 3 call details for each caller.6. at the back, the dual camera, which boasts of capturing depth of field, is a crap. it shoots out of focus photos more often than a sharp one and only shoots in bright light.( I have thoroughly clicked many snaps with that option.)7. no inbuilt app for selecting other themes.8. battery of 4000mAh doesn't perform well. it hardly lasts 16hrs with a heavy use of internet(wifi/mobile data)9. the product comes with a clear tag 'with new system update' - but till date I have neither received any software/system update nor have I been notified about it. and I am worried if it (oreo update) brings up new issues of malfunctioning as reported widely in different forums.I feel so tired of writing these 'cons' about k8, that it will be difficult to explain its 'pro's after this.amazon has been good as always in delivery."
2968,0,Screen cast not working
2969,0,All features are good except the screen quality. I have kept it in my mobile pocket while driving. When I have taken it back in my hand i have seen cracks in screen. I have seen the videos saying screen is strong but it is not. For replacing screen lenovo authorised service centres are mentioning different prices in different service centre. One lenovo service centre quoted 8500. Another Lenovo service centre quoted 5800

Press back right now and look at K5 Vibe.Update : After latest update Bluetooth A2DP doesn't work."

3147,0,"Overall its quite a good phone when compared to others in its segment and certainly one cant compare this one with One Plus... or Samsung/Apple High end phones.

3165,0,"Camera click makes a big sound as if an old camera of 1950's was working! There is no ear phone cord with the package and software space left out of 4 GB RAM after minimal pre-installed software is too small. Performance is just OK. Rest of it is being explored still, as I got the delivery on 23.10.17. Charger cable is shorter this time than it has been with lenovo previously, perhaps to cut costs. Not a phone to be proud of in this price segment.Some negative features of Amazon cannot be blamed on Lenovo.Phone heats up quickly. I just checked it twice. Avoid it. I downgraded it further from "" so-so"" to ""cheap"".Sajad Ahmed"

3203,0,"Cast screen is also not working and found the same complaint From several customers on Lenovo portal all phones of K8 Sires are def and Dumb. Did a research and spoke with Lenovo Tech Agent and found this is a ""Stock Android"" OS based phone thus Customer needs to make a additional Hardware purchase for Google Cromecast Dongle to make Cast Screen, This Information they should provide while selling this. Yellow light of camera- Who makes flash light with Yellow light that's too for rear camera photographs. Amazon has Lied to me for the return of this product. Had to reset phone same day since google service was not working even other applications were also got crashed. After phone reset it is giving the same problem. Camera is very poor darn bad, don't go for this phone. With 13 mp you cannot take 16:9 photos and it's very poor feature when comes to take in depth photograph. Over all bad phone single camera is better then dual camera with 13&5 mp cameras which cannot shoot full screen or 16:9 photographs. If I could rate this experience to day as append with Amazon Rep did not even provided Supervisor that Woman rep was awful. No Quick Replacement or Exchange even I am Prime Member. Snap deal has given me replacement in 2 days with pickup and new item delivery same day. I appreciate SNAP DEAL."

3449,0,"About Packaging and delivery :Received the phone on next day as i had paid extra for 1 day delivery but the packaging through which i received the phone was extremely poor.Able to see the phone box thoroughly from outside because of poor amazon cover packaging.About phone :I am writing this review after 3 months of usage of phone.Pros :* It has all the features you want to buy like 12 sensors, fast fingerprint detect, front flash. On april 28th 2018 received the android 8.0.0 os update.Dont know whether lenovo is going to provide further updates or not.*Battery life is of 2 and half days if mobile data is off and if mobile data is on battery will empty within 15 hrs after heavy use.*Phone built quality is good but not that great.*Camera performance is average.*It takes 2 hrs to 2hrs 30 minutes time for charging if battery low at 15 % or below. Soemtimes while charging it shows 5 hrs or 6hrs or 1day time to charge the phone.But after restart the actual charging time shows.*Sound quality due to dolby atmos is very good. Without it sound is low.*Processor and ram are good. There is no lagging observed.Cons :* Phone is giving heating issues in between and after restart its temperature gets to normal.*Sometimes called person unable to hear voice as the mic is on down side so need to bring down the phone towards your mouth to talk.Mobile signal quality is good"
3450,0,Performance is good ....but battery does not feel like a 4000mah kind. Looks are boring and the camera isn't that rich in terms of quality...yaaa but it is a good buy for 12000...can compare and make your choice...🤞

The wallpaper blacked out ( means interface freeze) on the first day ... The phn is highly unstable ...the software is also not working properly... Dont buy it ...and also ..amazon's customer service agents are just giving me the excuse of proper process of returning..... They are just trying to get rid of the scenario.....
3546,0,poor product
3547,0,"Bought this phone on 25th got it delivered by 27th and after using it for a week can say that the phone features and speed is good. Sound is good ,Back camera is good after OTA update front camera is average. Battery survives through the day and charges to 100% in about one and a half hour. The major issue which I faced was network issues for the incoming calls . For which have to return the phone to Amazon else the phone was good . Probably that defect might have been only on my handset. Anyways getting the refund so not much of worry ."
3548,0,After using the phone for 4 months. I am disappointed.There is problem in Bluetooth. Not works properly with Bluetooth speaker.Can lenovo give update for this?
3549,0,Bad cameras...
3550,0,I am using Lenovo k8 note and found that this is useless phone very poor processor heat too much
3551,0,"Phone looks good and screen is good too. But the battery is poor. Even though it is of 4000 mAh capacity, it doesn't even last for 24 hours. Even though the brand says that there is Turbo charging, it actually takes 3 hours to charge fully. So basically you will need to charge your phone twice in a day for 3 hours each time."
3552,1,Good handling and best technology for Motorola Ltd India is the best
3553,0,"Don't buy this product, I brought it last year in December, just after 3 months, started having heating problems and phone turning off, then eventually it stopped working, went to service center, they said motherboard problems, but they don't have motherboard currently to change it, so after waiting for quite a few days, took it back and showed it at another place, then also not repaired, then again gave to service center, they said warranty is over as its opened outside, then i said i will pay for whatever repair there is, they said motherboard cost 14,500, THAT'S EVEN MORE THAN THE COST OF PHONE NOW, SO NOW THAT PHONE IS WASTAGE, COMPANY IS JUST NICKING CUSTOMERS BECAUSE THEY PRICED ITS PARTS SO HIGH THAT NO ONE WOULD GO FOR REPAIR, SO RECOMMEND NOT TO GO FOR THIS PHONE OR YOU WILL REGRET IT"
3554,0,Fluctuating wifi receiving signals. Wifi gets disconnected too frequently within my home. I also have Motorola phone with which I donot face this wifi drop so frequently. Signals dropping is very irritating and frustrating while working online

3632,0,"Not at all recommended. My Lenovo K8 has the following issues:1. Poor signal strength - Tried different SIMs like Vodafone, JIO, etc, But signal shows only 2-3 bars. Whereas the same SIMs when inserted in other 4G handsets, it shows full strength n no call drops.2. Heating Problem: The company has added 4000 mAh battery because they knew that this handset will get heated and drained battery quickly. On using simple day-to-day work, it gets heated like anything. And the full battery drains within half day.3. Slow Performance: Even after introduced 4GB RAM, the handset is slow. It's not clear n not declared which type of 4 RAM they have inserted.I ordered the first day of its launch at Amazon. And one of the early users. But my overall expectations are not met... And not satisfied with the money I spent."
3633,1,Super value for money..Al though depth mode takes time to shoot but results are good enough for a budget phone

3659,0,Handset is just good can't give it 5 out of 5.Pros:1.design is awsome good looking2. Phone response is also good.3. Screen is awsome.Cons:1. It's heated on calls and charging.2. Camera effect.. Don't expect much just because of dual camera it only gives you certain option such as blur background or change it.3. 40000 mh battery is not going to help you a lot..It's not providing you a long life phone is diacharged with in 7-8 hours if you are using Internet (obviously that you will).4. Here is some problem with files stored in phone also.memory is being occupied with unnecessary things.After all I can conclude that phone is good durable good looking..But you Should not expect any magical things with it. As it's just higher than the normal smart phones.

3742,0,"I am writing this review after 7 months of usageIn the package: Mobile, turbo charging adapter, USB Cable, plastic case, normal screen guard, sim ejector toolCamera: Good for photos and videos in this pricing segment for daylight images. Struggles when it comes to night photography. Slow motion video recording is defiantly not up to the mark.OS: Got the system update, Lenovo keeps sending the software updates time to time. Despite keeping the software of the phone up to date the performance of the phone is not up to the mark> Phone & contacts (both are default) apps doesn't work some times takes 30 to 40 sec to load the screen> Any app be it Facebook, Instagram etc., handgs once in a day due to phone performance issues (what is the point of having 4 GB ram)> Heating issue when playing heavy games like Asphalt 8 and the app hangs giving worst gaming experienceBattery:4000 mAh battery, takes 3 hours to charge from 0% to 100% with the turbo charger provided. If you are a heavy user battery comes for 6 to 8 hours else it might come for 12 hours at max.Phone speaker: Not loud enough while playing music out, also while in traffic you can't hear the calls, absolutely not even a single word. Speaker sucks"
3743,1,Really nice..
3744,0,"Expect for the Ram & internal memory the function of this K8 note is far below previous K4 note which Iam using presently. The camera is very poor and Dolby Atmos function is totally useless again when compared to K4 note. I expected too much and thought will be better than K4 note in all terms. Extra features like flip phone power off, full screen photo,in built Dolby function present in K4 not available in K8. Single speaker is totally poor when compared to twin speakers in K4."

3758,1,Product is really awesome I like the battery backup. But the screen quality is not so good and it's not up to the mark. But phone is really good.
3759,0,"There were so many features are missing, where when we compare to other lenovo phone.Battery is not much worthy and it is been mentioned 4000 mah but the battery back up is too low.there was lot of bugs were seen in one day usage itself.Finger print is working fine.camera is also good and great,design of the mobile phone is good.a dedicated memory card slot is very good and we can use both sim and a memory card. that one of the biggest advantage in thisIn overall, it is not worthy for 13k mobile, if more features are been added ,may be it can be worthy for that amount"

3769,0,"Audio problem , no multi tasking, Bluetooth not matching with audio"
3770,1,This Lenovo phone is really awesome !Unexpected things were :It has 2.5D curve screen and the display is quite big looks really good in reality .Display is clear and shiny.The customized keypad..It has been customized systematically not so big not so small just perfect.it covers small portion of the screen.which is really sensible thing according to me .Everything else is perfect.
3771,0,Can't buy this phone because many features not run properly .mobile hang problem. cast screen not work. Basic applications not in-built
3772,1,killer device nothing to say
3773,0,Battery problem

3782,0,This hand set is not working well.
3783,0,Bakwaas
3784,1,Nice
3785,0,Not so good as hyped while launching.... Average processor ( keeps on hanging even after 4GB ram). Battery rated for 4000mah but lasts for half a day only. Phone heating is another issue. Call recording missing....
3786,1,"original product , delivered on time and working"
3787,0,"Very bad camera quality and camera depth feature not working properly , I have problem with battery charging it's charging very very slow lenovo disappointed me"

3789,1,Item is damaged
3790,0,"No handfree with handset, I am a music lover so that deal was very costly for me. Remaining is good....."
3791,0,"because this phone is not voLte support, only Lte"
3792,1,Camera quality is great.. Can click pics in hdr and also many options on focus etc...
3793,0,Camera Quality is good not super
3794,1,Fantastic phone with all high quality specs. But phone is slightly heating but now every phone does
3795,0,"It's a pretty decent phone. The dual camera isn't that great. Discharge rate is faster. The screen is very fragile. I have dropped my mobile only once, that too not on the screen facing side. It broke into pieces. Proper screen guards are also not available due to the screen curved design."
3796,1,"A very good phone with ample storage and fast processor. My phone storage is now 50% full but it works just as fast! Cameras at both ends are pretty good. Depth in videos are well observed. Brightness, lack of it, is a minor drawback."
3797,1,Good
3798,0,I used this phone for only 11 days and suddenly battery drain and now phone is not butting on. May be software corrupted. Completely dissatisfied with the phone.
3799,0,Mobile has fallen down from half meter above and display broken.Gorilla glass is not genuine.
3800,1,Great performance. Camera is excellent.but some things heating at charging time. Otherwise awosame I love Lenovo k8 note. The best product sell by Amazon.
3801,0,👍👍👍
3802,0,"It's the jack of all trades but king of none. Battery back up could have been better if they used some other processor. Battery drains quite fast. Camera is better than average. And I think there is no option to keep external media as your ringtone. Only custom build ringtones available to set as your ringtone. Kinda bums me out.Update after 3 day use:Battery back up is really horrible, normal usage like whatsapp and Instagram browsing consumes more than 25% battery in an hour or so.Then there is turbocharging issue, it starts with fast charging then after 10-20 minutes,depending upon mood, rate decreases, it took 7 hours to charge it by 40% in total.Would really appreciate if Amazon could take this matter seriously and take it up with Lenovo and return the money of its customers for defective models. I personally would not trust my 14K bucks with Lenovo or Moto from this point on."
3803,1,Ooosm phone...
3804,0,Too much heat think before buying it?
3805,1,Nice phone
3806,1,What is not in k8 note:-1) Gallery2) Battery percentage3) Dolby isn't up to the mark... ( As compare with Lenovo k4 note)4) Crop age option5) Can't set ringtone as u want...6) Took 8 hours to full charge....Except that it is best mobile of lenovo

3816,1,Great piece of equipment brought out by Amazon. I liked the dual rear camera performance. I recommend this product with the price tag range.
3817,0,If anyone is thinking about this phone then bro/sis you are going for a very bad phone other companies are offering very good mobiles in this rangeThere are not any specifics near description no turbo charger and battery quality is also very bad drains too fast brightness issue also and phone heats unexpectedly even in ideal conditionI think Amazon is selling duplicate product or this mobile is worst

3824,0,"1. Serious HEATING issues on the back side.2. Headphone slot is narrow. U have push headphone jack very hard. By doing so you might break your jack.3. Not latching to the mobile network easily.4. Lookwise just a regular SLAB phone.5. It's HEAVY.NOT EXPECTED FROM A BRAND LIKE LENOVO.It's not a KILLER phone. LENOVO, You just KILLED the Lenovo K8 NOTE Branding."
3825,0,"All hype no performance.. truly disappointed by this phone. Terrible camera, heavy, battery issue, hangs even though it's stock android with 4 go ram..."

3830,0,"(1)This phone have network problems probably secondary to sim card socket problem .(2) immediately battery drain.(3) here written returnable in 7 days , but once it delivered u can't return to Amazon or dealer."

3833,0,Heavy
3834,1,"At first I was worried whether to buy this mobile or not because the reviews were very bad, but I still bought it. After using this mobile for three months I realised that all those reviews were not that true. I play heavy games easily on this mobile it does not hang at all. Any device gets a little warm while working that doesn't mean that it's not working properly. The battery life is also good. There is no other mobile with so many features at so less price. I am really happy with it."
3835,1,1. Product received on time.2. The packing of the product was not up to the mark definite scope of improvement for Amazon.3. Product received in very good condition.4. Phone working in good condition with no problem of hanging any time.5. Satisfied with camera quality both rear and front.6. Slightly on heavier side in weight and does get heated up .7. Over all satisfied with the product.
3836,0,Pros1. Comes with a factory fitted silicon case2. Ok interface for stock Android.3. Good looking phone4. Dolby Atmos is a good inclusionCons1. Battery on single SIM lasts 12-14hrs (for a power user). A dual SIM would further reduce longevity.2. The much vaulted camera has a delayed shutter action.I used this phone after using a Redmi 3S. The K8 pales in comparison in terms of key user parameters.
3837,0,plzz dont buy this phone if you are accepting that this phone battery will long last till a day thats not possible beacuse this phone battery drains very fast inspite of being a 4000mah battery ultimately this phone is worthless i had wasted my money plzz u dont dare to do the same this phone has heating problem too iam crying for my money know this is a dumb phone

Build and camera quality is much much better than k8 note."
3891,0,Nice
3892,1,Fresh as lime....thnx...
3893,0,"Turbo charging has stopped after 5 days. It takes over 3 hours to charge the phone using the official Lenovo charger. Battery backup is hardly 17 hours on full charge and low usage. The Lenovo user forum is full of complaints pertaining to battery backup of this phone. The troubleshooting steps suggested by Lenovo technical support have not helped at all.Other issues include low signal on 2nd sim ( irrespective of telecom provider), alarm not working when phone is switched off or on battery saver.The Deca core processor is extremely powerful and the phone is blazing fast. Just doesn't hang or lag. However despite having a 4000 mAh battery, the backup is appalling, making the phone completely unreliable. What is the point in having so much horsepower when there is no battery backup to power it. No wonder the phone was being sold at a steep discount.The reviews posted on Amazon are not 100% factual or accurate.Go through this link before you decide to buy the phone : https://forums.lenovo.com/t5/K8-XT1902-Smartphones/hi-guys-is-there-any-solution-for-battery-drain-issue-in-lenovo/td-p/3777078"

3988,1,"Loved this Device. Fast Charging, Good processor speed, Dolby Sound is Awesome, Screen Clarity is fabulous.Looking into the specifications, somewhere Camera quality is compromised. No Headphone with set is really a pain."
3989,1,Good
3990,1,It’s okay....
3991,0,Overall the phone is good. But there is a issue with the volte on Jio as if the phone is kept idle for 10mins then you ll keep on missing calls as the other party ll get that your sim is either switched off or not reachable. This is a big flaw if the phone is volte enabled. As one can't continuosly keep on using the phone just to receive a call.A software update is required in this regards.
3992,1,Just purchased the product and feature and working good. Batary back up comes only one day if you are not browsing much. Otherwise everything else looks good. Primary camera resolution not so high. But it's ok.
3993,0,This product is not good because many problems in this...1st of calling problem 2nd of internet problem .3rd of music sound problem..4th of 4g net connectivity start than call not now...So my suggestion is this product not purchased...
3994,1,Good product
3995,0,Very bad experience

3997,0,"Issues faced from the day of purchase itself!1. Flickering of brightness light2. Dead Pixel (white) on screen3. No in-build gallery4. Heating while running application5. Even the battery is 4100 mAh drains out quite quickly not as expected6. While running application phone sometimes hangs7. A very bad experience while receiving the phone that is no delivery, late delivery and defective product received by this particular seller.8. As features mentioned on social media about the phone are very good but according to my experience it's not up to the mark. So guys think twice before you make a purchase and make sure read all reviews from other customers too it's just my personal opinion"
3998,1,Amazing phone with great RAM..camera quality also good...

4017,1,Awesome mobile
4018,0,Battery back up is wrost..all other fesilite is wpr
4019,0,Not good as expected. Heating too much and I faced charging issue after software update. Might be conflict between hardware and updates which clearly shows incompatible hardware. You get only 1 day battery backup and you have to keep battery saver mode on if you're not using else it drains super fast. Being Lenovo K4 Note owner I had much expectations with K8 Note though it didn't meet any of my expectation.

4063,0,Cancelled order before delivery. The reviews are very bad for Oreo update. The phone becomes unusable and mother board is also affected by the update. Frequent restarts is the most common problem faced by users.
4064,1,Good Phone.
4065,0,Lenovo k8 note has severe issues like 1. The in-bound and out-bound voice calls are not working while the phone is kept idle for 1 hr or more. 2. JIO video call is not working. 3. The mobile hangs when the camera options are changed. 4. The carrier signals showing weak though the other phones like lenovo k5 note shows good strength. 5.

4071,0,Not as expected
4072,0,"The phone boasts a lot but is a let down. I took it with a lot of expectations cuz this phone basically combines the best of both worlds the redmi note 4 and Moto g5s plus and more. It's a Jack of all trades and a master of none (except maybe music ). The battery drains during standby and moderate gaming for like ten minutes causes it to heat up.It has Dolby Atmos Sound Enhancement and a Dedicated Music Key which is a unique feature. People who like music, might appreciate it. The fact that the Sim slot is not Hybrid is another plus point."
4073,0,"Not so good as expected.battery backup is poor .Not worth to buy @13999 rs.It's a not a true smart phone,it's poor in functions,there r so many cons with this phone.dont buy pls.Can Amazon or seller ll buy back.I don't want this phone."

4257,1,"Very Good Mobile set even low cost, Not comparable any other mobile with this cost."
4258,1,Everything is more than average. It is a all rounder phone. But music output is too artificial. The natural sound is totally absent. There is a trend going on nowadays and even people are liking these artificial sound outputs(Dolby Atmos).

No proper responce after multiple complaints.No headset in boxpros:Good sounddisplay is much better than other phones in this price rangeBattery Backup is goodBody finishing is betterOverall good phone if there is no network issue. I strongly suggest not to buy it through amazon or anyother marketplace. Visit physical store so that you can check the phone at the time of buying.

4273,1,Awesome phone with long battery life and good camera quality. Turbo charger really charges fast and as I'm a moderate phone user my phone's battery lasts almost whole day. I charge it only once a day and sometimes even after 24 hrs
4274,0,"Pros & Cons explained.                   1. Very good, sleek design and elegant look, just alike iPhone 7 Plus.2. Very fast, Storage is abundant with SD Card support is a plus.3. Sim and SD Card slots are seperate.4. Very smooth to touch and Android Nougat rocks!Cons:1. Battery runs up drained too fast when connected via 4G LTE or WiFI.2. Volume is very low than you can really imagine, when played via earplugs / Wired Headsets / Bluetooth Headset or Speakers.3. No inbuilt Gallery app or a music player, so PowerAmp supports well, when purchased at $1.Rest all are great, including the delivery, which is very fast."

There dialing page is not user friendly, frequent dialed number are displayed in large size hence leading to unnecessary calling on frequent dialed.

4325,1,Fantastic Phone in every aspect. gets charged very quickly. Amazing sound quality for high quality movies. It has dolby Atmos sound. If you enable dolby and watch movies with dolby sound you will get real theatric effect on this little phone with headphones on. Real value for money. I am really surprised by the sound quality.
4326,1,It's an excellent piece of art based on performance and battery... But 15W turbo charger is not the right name for it's charger because it takes around 150mins to nearly 3 hours sometimes to charge the mobile

If you continue talking to someone via call for over 30 minutes, the device will get so hot that it can burst in any point of time. Its been only 6 months now that I am using this and I am facing such problems. Even when the charger is connected the battery continues to discharge.

4435,0,"Hello,The phone starts resetting itself randomly. This issue starts after after 3 days of use, especially when you use it for longer time like watching a you tube video for an hour or two. The issue starts to repeat after 1 or 2 days, then I tried few option mentioned in Lenovo help APP which is pre-installed(I am feeling like a stupid for having done this) , after that for 4 or 5 days it didn't show this issue. Now it back with a bang and almost resets itself every night. Use the phone in night, then lock it and keep aside and when you take the phone again in the morning, boom, it is dead already. And when you manually power-on there is enough juice left in the battery. Not sure what to do with this kind of issue, the phone is absolutely useless.When I approached amazon for return, they are quoting policy and suggest me that I should run pillar to post to get problem rectified (not sure even it is rectifiable issue), The below Amazon's tagline tag-line sounds funny"" Earth's Most Customer-Centric Company."", I am not really sure whether they understood what they really mean, I am already started feeling bitter for my purchase decision in Amazon and now I realized that buying Lenovo brand is same as throwing your money into garbage."

4611,0,"Performance wise, it is worth of the cost. However is low on quite few details.Very vulnerable to accidental falls or pressure. Screen and camera glass are too cracky. Mine got few cracks and I could not even understand how it happened. To state I keep the phone with utmost care with back cover and screen guard.This lacks inbuilt contact saver.It saves in your email account.Lacks feature to personalise ringtone till you download ringtone cutter and make the ringtone.Transfer of files are tough. Personalisation of various options is not convenient. RAM usage remains always high for very basic usage with FB,Gmail,WhatsApp applications only.Adding to the above the cons as below after about 2 months usage.1.Gets hung up frequently.2.Applications including GUI gets hung.3.Finger print detection lags.4.No inbuilt contact memory. It always saves stuff in email account.5.Screen is not tough at all. Not upto the mark of gorrilla glass as specified.6. Files do not get arranged properly."

4669,0,"Lenovo K8 once again tries to bring multi features under affordable limit. Worst try. Just used the phone for few days and the handset started displaying it's faults. It takes minimum 4-5 hours to charge the phone. The handset gets heated up as much that you can warm your coffee cup. Within 3 days off purchase, the handset started displaying software update alert. The camera is good but consumes battery as if the handset gets hungry while photography. Not recommended until Lenovo fix the defects. Am sure, Lenovo would soon pull out the phone from market.Buy the phone at your own risk."

4687,0,"I wanted to use for few days and then write a feedback. Its been 9 days while writing this feedback. My experience with amazon support and the phone is not satisfactory at all. The moment I got the phone, I did all the transfer of credentials. After a day, I started facing this unique issue regarding loss of my data internet. It would show the 4G icone with full network strength but there was a cross sign on that network strength tower. I realised very soon that I cannot access to internet as long as that cross sign is there. I had to restart the device or wait for few hours to get the things right. This used to happen atleast 4 to 5 times in a day.So I reported this issue to amazon via app. There was an option to select the return item option but apparently that link will ask you to talk to amazon tech support or install some software for checking your phone.Amazon tech support sent a technician and all that he did was factory reset. After doing this, the phone's data internet was working fine. So accordingly he mentioned in his service report and handed over the copy to me.But immediately after he left, I started having the same issue. I reported to amazon again. This time amazon customer care team tells me that technician did not find any fault hence you have to submot more proofs.I did that as well. But there is no solution to this. I check some forum online and came to know that this is a known issue with this device. Had I known before buying, I would not have bought it at all."

Updated to Oreo and looks very good. Owned this for more than 6 months. Used to have camera issues which has never appeared after the Oreo update. I play PUBG with this phone every day and sometimes lags slightly which is not very much noticeable but still there. I don't keep many apps installed on my phone. I like to keep it clean and don't know how good the games would perform in a phone with tonnes of apps installed. Everythings okay except Bluetooth. Bluetooth doesn't work properly! It sucks so bad, the audio lags terribly. Tested in multiple Bluetooth headphones/speakers and still the same. Contacted Lenovo multiple times for this issue and no help. If you're a music person using Bluetooth headsets don't buy this phone, it'll irritate the s*** out of you. I'm giving one star due to poor support from Lenovo,"

4981,0,"Update - 28-04-2018Lenovo K8 note world wide has signal reception issues. The Lenovo service center wrote and gave me this on paper after being unable to repair my phone.My phone was at the service center for nearly 2 weeks now for signal issues. Even after changing the motherboard, the issue is not resolved.DO NOT buy Lenovo & Moto phones. If you still decide to go ahead, please visit the service center once to see the rush!(Wish I could give 0 star)The signal reception is very bad. Most of the times the same sim which functions with full signal strength on other 4G phone will give no signal on Lenovo K8 note. I have been begging Lenovo, escalated till their corporate teams and their response is not even professional.In my 6 months, my phone has spent nearly one month in the service centre with no effect. Cheap people at the service centre also. Even the systems in their service centre does not work !Buy this phone only for its camera.The phone is really heavy. The metal body will dent at the slightest impact."

4990,0,"Lenovo is known for cheap and feature rich phone. Lenovo note is its one of the most popular phone lineup. Let's see what phone has to offer in therms of quality and performance and what are its shortcomings.ProsIt is dual sim volte 4g phone which means it will work with almost every telecom service provider.Full Metal body. In this price range very few brands are offering full metal body.Comes in two variants 3GB of RAM and 32GB 4GB RAM and 64GB GB. Both variants has enough ram and storage space.Note K8 note is using Mediatake Hellios x23 Deca Core Soc Processor this processor is very capable and its performance rivals with Snapdragon Soc.It is one the cheapest phone with dual camera with phase detect. The primary sensor is 13mp while secondary is 5mp. The camera is coupled with fast lens.Front camera is 13 mp With moderately fast lens. Both front camera and back camera has flash and they both perform well. Video and photo has enough details.Just like previous models, K8 note also has standard 5.5 inch full hd display. Screen is bright and has ample contrast.Now K8 note is using latest stock android. Stock android tends to be more responsive than modified version and has less bloatware.It has 4,000mAh battery with turbo charge support.It is water resistant.For music lovers it have dedicated music key.Audio is very clean and Supports dolby sound enhancement.Has home button and back button.Supports wifi ac band.It has dedicated card slot.Support USB On Go.Cons:-Comes without earphones.Sim and SD Insert and Remove Mechanism Needs a pin to insert or remove sim or sd card.No NFC present.No infrared support.Slow camera lens which leads to bad low light performance.Does not have either usb 3.0 or usb c.Even though processor itself support 4k video phone does not support it.Does not have enough service center. Service after sales is not adequate.Battery performance and usages average, will depend on usages pattern and apps used:-Charging time approximately 2 hours with stock charger.Web Browsing wifi and mobile data 10 hours.Only calling nothing else 20 hours.Video Playback 14 Hrs.Verdict.K8 note is a feature rich phone which follows the foot print of older device. It would be perfect device it it had 4K and dust resistant support. Nonetheless it is very competitive decide and I do recommend this phone as this phone has almost everything which will sufficient for most users. If you are looking to buy this phone I will recommend 4GB version as it offers best value for money.I hope that my review helped you. If you have any other question fell free to comment below or message me directly. I will be glad to assist you and answer all your queries."

5013,1,This one is osm.
5014,0,"Wish there was an option for Zero Star.The new Android Update to Oreo is not supported by the phone which is causing the phone to charge really slow after the update.Ideally, a turbocharger charges in less than an hour but this one takes more than 2 and Lenovo technical support is also full of lame and dumb people who will tell you that the charging should take 1 hour and 40 minutes (that is what a normal fast charger does and not a turbocharger).buy any other phone that already has an oreo update."

5097,0,I bought this phone and regret my decision. I bought this over redmi note 4 just because of camera but the dual camera sucks it gives very artificial bokeh effect.

But lenovo is notorious for not providing updates even for phone priced higher than this devices.

Its one of the major reasons i decided to go for this phone.Battery back up is satisfactory. Easily lasts a day. There is some scope of improvement however.Turbo charging is a plus.Haven't come across any heating issues.Cons:Facing issues with jio sim intermittently.Call recording feature is missing.Miss Gallery. Not too fond of Google Photos app.Dual sim set up feature is rubbish. Does not meet my requirements. No option to send messages from 2nd sim.

5408,0,this phone comes with lots of probleam and i am buy this phone only features for dual camera but i am not satisfied of this phone because secondary camera are not work in depth mode and clear photos as low light i hope the secondary camera is not any work here?My suggestion lenovo improve ur quality and features.There is nothing like what you are getting on the phone's features if you are taking dual camera for a bad phone
5409,0,MAJOR PROBLEM IS PHONE CHARGING....EVERY 12 HOURS IT REQUIRED CHARGINGPHOTOS ARE ALSO NOT UPTO THE MARK..
5410,0,Normal
5411,0,Device was delivered to me on 16th sept and with in a span of one week it had issue of restarting again and again while in usage (in idle too). Approached the service center with the same... they took 4 days of time and returned me back saying there wont be further issues but in less than two days of their service mobile started behaving the same... still the mobile is in service center....Finally my suggestion...Before making a decision of buying a Motorola / lenovo mobile please visit their service center near by. By seeing the number of people carrying their new mobiles.. you can come to conclusion that its waste of money first then waste of time approaching them.

5448,0,"Indian mobile sector is dominate by two kind of manufacturer, one who are capable of big marketing budget and another who offers mobile at cheap price. Lenovo is known for feature rich phone. Lenovo note is its one of the most popular phone lineup. Let's see what phone has to offer in therms of quality and performance and what are its shortcomings.ProsIt is dual sim volte 4g phone which means it will work with almost every telecom service provider.Full Metal body. In this price range very few brands are offering full metal body.Comes in two variants 3GB of RAM and 32GB 4GB RAM and 64GB GB. Both variants has enough ram and storage space. 4GB version offers best value for money.Note K8 note is using Mediatake Hellios x23 Deca Core Soc Processor this processor is very capable and its performance rivals with Snapdragon Soc.It is one the cheapest phone with dual camera with phase detect. The primary sensor is 13mp while secondary is 5mp. The camera is coupled with fast lens.Front camera is 13 mp With moderately fast lens. Both front camera and back camera has flash and they both perform well. Video and photo has enough details.Just like previous models, K8 note also has standard 5.5 inch full hd display. Screen is bright and has ample contrast.Now K8 note is using latest stock android. Stock android tends to be more responsive than modified version and has less bloatware.It has 4,000mAh battery with turbo charge support.It is water resistant.For music lovers it have dedicated music key.Audio is very clean and Supports dolby sound enhancement.Has home button and back button.Supports wifi ac band.It has dedicated card slot.Support USB On Go.Cons:-Comes without earphones.Sim and SD Insert and Remove Mechanism Needs a pin to insert or remove sim or sd card.No NFC present.No infrared support.Slow camera lens which leads to bad low light performance.Does not have either usb 3.0 or usb c.Even though processor itself support 4k video phone does not support it.Does not have enough service center. Service after sales is not adequate.Battery performance is similar to Moto G5s. Battery performance depends on background application, temprature, brigtness and usages pattern.Charging time approximately 2 hours with stock charger.Web Browsing wifi and mobile data 10 hours.Only calling nothing else 20 hours.Video Playback 14 Hrs.Verdict.K6 note is a feature rich phone which follows the foot print of older device. It would be perfect device it it had 4K and dust resistant support. Nonetheless it is very competitive decide and I do recommend this phone as this phone has almost everything which will sufficient for most users. If you are looking to buy this phone I will recommend 4GB version as it offers best value for money.I hope that my review helped you. If you have any other question fell free to comment below or message me directly. I will be glad to assist you and answer all your queries."

5455,0,"This device deserves a four star and has all the potential to be the killer IF ONLY lenovo could roll out a software update soon.. with mi a1 in the market with Android One there is no way lenovo could chiken out on these bug fixes...Though the performance is fast and fluid, battery bugs relating to phone idle, mild heating issues, non functional dual camera( is it just a gimmick dear lenovo?? you couldn't use the two sensors to deliver a real bokeh?? its just masking now) let me down... FIX IT WITH A SOFTWARE UPDATE LENOVO.. GONE ARE THE SPEC GAMES.. WE NEED UPDATES NOW"

Else phone is a breeze... Go for it. Better than me and honor 9 lite.Dual camera at the back and selfies are better than latest mi... I used to love mi selfies but Lenovo turned it around...I had a k5 note earlier... K8 note has better gui and smooth operation...Forget vivo and oppo as well... The best in the class with a gorilla glass!!!
5465,1,I use this from 2 months. All most phone performance is good. Also good for gaming. No hanging problem. There is only 1 problem in Dolby atom. But in this price phone is too good. Bad thing is that in box u can get only phone and charger nothing else.

5656,0,There are speakers in both sides of the charging port.But sound comes only from the right side.No sound in the left side speakers.This is a main issue I face.Duel camera mode is fake...Camera Test..I opened the camera and put my finger on the back top camera.At that time no obstruction is found.Then I turn on the depth mode and again put my finger on the top camera. This time also nothing happened. That means the top camera in the backside is only a dummy. It is not at all working.

5677,0,How to return this.?
5678,0,Worse product ... poor battery
5679,0,Not as expected
5680,0,"(I've had this phone for 5 weeks now.)The phone comes with a clear hard case (I'm pissed my case came PRE-scratched and strangely stained) and no accessories except for the turbo charging adapter+USB cable.1. The primary camera is alright - I used to own a Mi3 (2014!!!) and this compares with it, which doesn't make it all that good for 2017. But good enough. I haven't tinkered with the depth enabled mode but I know it isn't flawless.2. The phone may seem a bit too heavy the first day or two. [I'm just glad I haven't dropped it on my face YET :( ]3. The front camera is pretty good - all things considering - and won't make you look too ugly, you'll end up with bright adequate selfies.4. I haven't had any heating issues like other reviews have mentioned, during heavy usage or while charging.5. The battery life is great and will last you nearly the whole day, unless you have the brightness on Max, the WiFi is on, SIM is enabled and you're continuously watching videos.6. Although there is only one speaker i.e only on the bottom, thanks to Dolby the sound is loud clear and pretty great.7. The headphone jack IS a tad annoying, you really have to push your headphones in.8. Turbo charging   around 2 hours, faster if you aren't using the phone at all and it's on airplane mode.9. Honestly, Stock Android pisses me off. I'm used to and love MiUI.10. I got my phone in the very first flash sale (Aug 25) so I had to settle for the 3GB/32GB version and it's adequate.11. The call quality is good enough.12. This phone isn't all that great at catching WiFi signals sometimes though, my 2014 Mi3 does better.All in all, it's a pretty good phone, definitely won't let you down (a lot) when you really need it to come through.But at this price range, you could probably do better. Also keep in mind returning the phone will be next to impossible."

5705,0,"Worst phone ever. I did not even want to rate it a star. The phone gets very much heated up. And the the charging doesn't stay for long, though there's a turbo charger with this device. Device is not worth taking. Better go for Mi redmi note 4. They say Mi blasts and heats up,but it is said only so that the MI market comes down, it's a cheap trick that are usually played by other competitors. I bought lenovo k3 note a year ago and it has network issues that were never been corrected by the service centre. And three months ago I bought another lenovo, lenovo k8 note, which is utter waste like k3. I gave my phone to service centre in Jayanagar, and instead of repairing it, they broke the back cover of the phone which is non removable cover. This was experience with this Product.So before you choose a product please do read the reviews."

That's a bad reviews by of mi note 4Front camera-k8 front camera is best then mi,Back camera- booth looks same.Display resulation and quality of display- k8 is good,If you talk about design k8 is better then mi but waight is more.Flashlight- mi back flash is good then k8, but front flash is good k8, it looks like Sony front camera.K8 is splash proof and gorilla Glass that's better then mi,When I using video calling front flash is not on means front flash option is not given on k8.After all things finally I gives 3* from k8 and 2* from mi...... Mi is bad charging issue is so so bad..... Short circuit issue may probably coming in next... Thanks to all who read my reviews I can't judge you but I hope you won't not buy Hopper mobile mi, in 1month it's issue is coming looks his future..."

If you are in doubt, search for K8 Note Oreo update and you will learn for your self.After Oreo update, the mobile always keeps hot even if its idle. You can't even pickup the phone and put it to your ears. Hope someone doesn't get hurt due to explosion of this phone.The battery drains very fast. Before oreo update battery used to last for 2 days for me, but now it doesn't even last 3-4 hours. Its even getting worse day by day.Due to heating not able to put the phone in pocket or even not able to keep it on ear when call comes, even if phone was idle since hour. The phone is still in warranty and Lenovo has no clue what's happening.Wish I am able to roll back the Oreo update or return the phone.If you haven't bought the phone yet : Wait till these issues get resolved.If you have already bought : DONT UPDATE TO OREO.If you have alreay updated to Oreo : God help you(like me), and start saving for another phone.Hope this helps and save people from getting burnt (literarry) by the phone.-Anup"

5773,0,Worst Lenovo I have ever used. The phone heats quickly. Don't even feel like handling it. Looks like I am stuck with it until I find another better phone in the market.
5774,1,"The Lenovo K8 Note smartphone is superb, looking very nice, working so fast and excellent. I am totally satisfied with this product. Thank you amazon."
5775,1,"In this budget, this is a very good phone. Only thing is both Sim will not be 4G at a time, and when call is coming in one sim, other sim is not working means missed call also not coming."
5776,0,Worst phone everNot even basic features like sim and 4g are working properly
5777,1,Wonder full
5778,0,Not satisfied with this phone.Fast charging is just bluff.It will not charge in minutes.Dolby sound is disable always you can't turn it on.Camera is also not up to mark.My previous Lenovo k6 plus has good camera as compare to this.And also it don't have auto call recorder and dual app inbuilt app.

As I thought that camera is great, but its so so.. okie okie...10/10 Processing is fast, doesn't lag, works smoothly.Heats a lot, while charging and while playing online games, like Clash of Clans.Charger makes too much noise, you cant use this in a packed room, produces annoying noise.10/10 Finger print Sensor, best in lenovo."

5801,0,Battery life of this mobile is very bad...Only 5-6 hrs battery backup...And it's been 2 months since I bought it.
5802,0,Device heats up a lot even when kept idle which leads to faster battery drain.Lenovo needs to sort this soon.rest is good.

5805,0,"Within 1 month of use, started hanging.One major draw back, It does not support miracast function. So you can not connect it to your smart TV. Surprisingly YouTube can be shared with TV. So they are forcing us to buy Chromecast."
5806,0,This is not a standard lenovo phone. No call recorder. Back button on opposite side.
5807,1,I love the phone. .
5808,0,"This phone gets heated up very quickly. There is no gallery, video player or music player.

5819,1,Very good phone in smart price.
5820,0,Horrable performance with VoLTE sim card. Poor coverage and always give message of switch off to remote person who is calling. So.many bugs in VoLTE software.Camera quality is not as per expectations what Lenovo is claiming in advertisements. Camera response also very slow.Depth mode is givien in camera but useless as after taking snap you have to edit photo and editing tool is also poor. Audio quality is average. Not satisfied. Not worth of money. Better handsets are available in same price.
5821,0,"Very disappointing , not up to the mark, returns issue problematic. Only replacement possible but amount not refundable."
5822,1,Best Mobile in medium range money comparing with top company mobiles .
5823,1,"Gorilla glass,all other things are good.speakers are good but it will give some low volume and there is nothing fault about Lenovo k8 note.It is good in price with all features camera is to develop.."
5824,0,both sims are not working 4 g slot 1 has not 4g option
5825,0,"At this price, its worth buying when you compare with Redmi series. Camera quality is not upto the level. looks good. only drawback is the turbo charger is not at all good, it took 5.5hrs for the battery to full from 7% and no where its called turbo. battery back up is little fine. for 14k you cannot expect many features,overall its worthy."
5826,1,Nice phone
5827,0,Glass breaks for a minor fall. Otherwise the product is good
5828,0,Bad phone...wifi signal is poor not even caching wifi few steps far from the wifi device
5829,0,Really killer experience...
5830,0,No volte. Low signal catch. Do not buy this.
5831,0,"Got the mobile on first sale. Of the main aspect of the phone on which Lenovo was emphasizing was dual rear cameras is not good at all. The depth enabled mode is totally of no use neither is the depth editor. All other aspect of the mobile is ok. A honest suggestion is to wait for mi 5x or Coolpad cool play 6 . The web support of Lenovo is also of no use. Raised a ticket on this issue still no answer or reply from them. God knows whether they ever see to mails or not. I made the mistake of buying this phone, all of you out there please dont make my mistake"

Lenovo rolled out the Oreo update in May 2018 and after that my phone has almost been crippled, the phone is taking 8 hours to get fully charged and the battery gets discharged in 5 hours, it gets heated like anything and has also start lagging. I have also done a factory reset as advised by the online customer care executive but it did not help, hope Lenovo releases an update soon."

5868,0,"Very bad camera Quality with this price range , front camera capturing only mirror image.Plz don't buy to see it's deca core processor and 4gb ram & 64 gb rom features if you want good photography mobile."
5869,0,"TL;DR: This phone sucks, expected much better from the makers of Moto. Even Moto G5+ is far better than this.Long version:My previous phone broke so I was in urgent need for a stopgap phone before waiting out for the price of LG G6 to drop. Shortlisted Honor 6x, Lenovo Z2 and Lenovo K8 Note. Bought this, after 10 days of use here is what I thinkPros:+ Photos are decent (compared to my last two phone that promised great camera but delivered little). The bokeh effect is not as good and Huawei's implementation.+ No bloat. It has stock android. Now stock android's blocky icons aren't my favorite but you can change that with a launcher.+ Programmable music button. I use that for turning on the flash light.+ Front flash+ Dedicated SDcard slot.Cons:+ Lag. Despite a deca core processor and 4GB of RAM, this piece of fine machinery is lagging, not on an intensive game like asphalt but Clash Royale. Even my mom's Redmi 3 will run that flawlessly.+ Battery. Another indicator that numbers don't always match the performance. I gotta charge it twice a day. And I miss fast charging.+ Notification LED: Only white, not red or green, but only white. No LED flash for Missed calls, the most important use of that LED.+ Software. In many little ways, the software seems much less integrated with the hardware compared to even Moto."

It is better not to buy lenovo , or buy with extended warranty for 2-3 years. Good luck but better choice to buy other phones."
5884,0,"Think before you buy this product, lots of setback but Lenovo support team doesn't seem to think about it. Network and headphone volume is few of the major concerns as I can't return this now on Amazon. Still waiting for an update that fixes few of the issues."

5887,0,Very bad phone waste your money
5888,0,Internet is not working properly
5889,0,"Updated review after posting it on 31st January for the updated issue read the last 2 pointsNote :- The review is been posted after using this smartphone for 6 days after I bought it through Amazon Independence SaleDespite having such a wonderful hardware configuration in this smartphone there are lot's of software bugs which ruined this phone even after the latest updates which I have listed below, I hope Lenovo provides a stable software through future updates :-1) All incoming messages in the phone are delayed by 10-20 minutes like all OTP messages or any kind of messages which made me annoyed especially while doing bank transactions.2) Random Power off issue. Phone gets randomly switch off while charging or while turning off the display by pressing lock button3) Battery backup is very poor I guess this is a hardware issue not a software issue because phones like Redmi Note 4 gave me almost a full day battery backup has I'm a heavy user and this phone gave me 7 hours of battery life it seems like Lenovo has cheated us by giving a label of 4000 maH battery backup which I think is only 2500 maH battery installed in this smartphone.4) Dual camera setup is just fake especially the depth mode from that 5 MP depth camera, in short it's just for name sake that this phone comes in dual camera setup.As far I have encountered only these 4 issues if I face more issues will update my review till then go for Mi A1 or Redmi Note 4 has per your budget atleast those phones have a stable software configured with their phones hardwareUpdate :-5) Phone gets hang very badly while doing multi tasking though having deca core processor you can only run maximum 4 to 5 apps in background what a joke seriously right, to overcome this hang one should do hard restart by pressing the power button for 10 to 20 seconds6) Another software bug is with notification light which is single white colour. No RGB notification light found in Redmi Note 4, but the true software bug is this notification light only works for pre installed applications on this phone. That means notification light won't blink for third party applications like Whatsapp, hike etc. But the notification light will blink for messages calls and gmail apps, another software joke from LenovoNote:- If I face more issues will update my review"

5926,0,Waste of Money and Time.. Brought this product recently. Not working properly with Android 8.0 update. Phone is discharging in minutes and taking more than 7hrs hours to 100% charging. While using the mobile its heating like a iron box...totally hated the product then Amazon replaced the product with a new device and again faced the same problem...service centres are also not answering properly. One of my friends also brought the same phone before 3 months. He updated the system to Android Oreo 8.0 and then the hell started in his device. We went to the device centre and asked to take the backup of our personal data for resetting the phone. We did it and handed over the device to them. In the evening they called us and told that the problem was rectified and asked us to collect the device. But the next day the problem repeated even more aggressively than earlier. Then we went again to the service centre and again explained the damn story. Then they changed the battery and gave us the phone back. But the next day again the problem repeating. So we finally went to them and asked them to replace the device with a new one but they said there is no such option to replace the defective problem and they can not help with the device problem. Finally one of the technician in the service centre told us that the problem is for all the K8 note devices after updating to Android Oreo 8.0. Then we asked him to degrade the Android version to Nought 7.1.1. Then he said they doesn't have the option to degrade the system update and told us that he'll inform when the degrade option is available with them. It has been 1 week since he told us. But till now we didn't received any patch for this system update or degrading option. So I suggest you guys please stay away of your thoughts of buying this product....have a good day...

5935,1,Good
5936,0,Its an overall good product but the oreo update isn't readyly available. The 4000 mh battery is just there to support the 10 core processor it dies not give an extended battery life. The mobile heats even on simple activities such as movies. The mobile body is great as it is full metal. The in-depth mode is a just show
5937,0,"Please don't buy this phone because of it is taking 8 hours to fill the battery , battery consumption also very more battery getting easlyy down"

5943,0,I m not satisfied with my setIt has issue with brightnessAnd clock is not showing correct timeAlso has heating issueI would not suggest to buy this set
5944,0,"Not satisfied as phone doesn't have cast screen option to wireless connectivity with smart TV, although other lesser value smartphones hv dis feature...very disappointed.plus battery back up is worst....really bad.."
5945,0,"After using this mobile phone for one month, I am writing this review.The main issue of this product is heating.During charging or even using it for fifteen minutes raises the temperature by at least 10 kelvin.The turbo charger is not good enough.Also the touch buttons below the screen are not back lit.Camera is just average. Low light performance is very bad.Design could have been better. Little bit thinner would be good.I think it's just an experimental product from Lenovo.I don't suggest anyone to buy it.I feel that Lenovo should immediately stop selling this product and recall all of them from the market ASAP.If there is any way to return it, then kindly let me know.MI A1 is far better at the same price range."
5946,0,Battery drain problem.... Otherwise it is ok
5947,0,Lenovo K8 note is above from any other sub15k range smartphones from lenovo but average in overall ratings. And little bit of heavy .lill bit of heating with continues usage .camera department is above of any other smartphones of this range but exception is it's dual camera setup which is only a hardware setup in smartphone but software is not that much supportive wuth dual camera setup. Front flash is soft and quite good.Stock android is impressive with it.Processor is not battery efficient as 4000mah not last long for a day. 4000mah battery is good on paper but in day to day life it is somewhere 3200mah.Build and looks are impressive.LED notification light is point to consider.Considering K8 note as a multimedia smartphone is fare ti rate it. Sound Quality is good display experience is also good as well.Dual Sim and dedicated SD card slot is nice effort with the fone.Dedicated music key is Good to have and ability to enable it for various operations is appreciabl.Fingerprint security is only upto lock unlock but you can't let it to secure any of your apps without any 3rd party apps. yes it works in capturing pictures through camera.Stock android is that much basic that even you can't hide apps in app drawer. It looks good but feels little less that even yiu can't hide unnecessary apps.
5948,0,The phone is slow than Lenovo K8 Plus. K8 Plus is better.
5949,1,rear camera depth mode and bokeh effect is not up to mark as expected.heat up[ while turbo charging and gaming.

5955,0,"Pros1) finally the Camera is awesome in Lenovo2) Deisgn is not a merit but it's okay for cost3) so far smooth performance didn't hanged.Cons1) If you are staying in hill stations as usual Lenovo is carrying the exothermic mechanism which liberates enough heat to keep your hand extra warm2) Turbo charging really works good but the bad thing is battery doesn't make you to feel 4000mah. Just stands for 5 to 6 hours of jio use3) Stock OS lacks lot of customization features that were available with earlier versions. The OS is just basic (Raw) no value addition had been done.4) Lenovo should concentrate on network ic (signal receiver) never shows full tower. So network consumes so much power I think so5) No headset? I mean, really? This is absolutely madness.6) speaker is of low quality"
5956,1,Don't believe any fake review. This is the best phone in this price range. No heating problem. No problem at all. Buy it as soon as possible.
5957,0,The mobile is not good as it is shown .it has Network problem& also toch performance is poor
5958,0,Battery backup is average. Screen guard can not be install properly because of its corved display.
5959,0,"Received the used piece, all the application were pre installed and you can see the images I've posted, (on Aug 29, 2017, received msg from Vodafone customer care).Note: Today only I received the mobile and last Saturday I ordered the mob i.e on 21st Jan, 2018.Before buying anything from this seller pls check weather you received the new product or the used one, anyway I've raised the complaint regarding this let me see what's going to happen."
5960,0,There's no cast option in the phone.Which has to be present .Something seems wrong with the cameraThe video doesn't have many options.
5961,0,Handset is looking good. Camera is not so good its ok. Battery backup very poor ya I know there is big big ram latest processor but it's too much drain fast while I am just whats app chatting. And turbo charger is very slow it look like ordinary charger. For 50% it's took 5 hours. And one more thing I don't have any kind of game or i m not playing it online but battery drain more than expectations. Its not worth price. It is best for ₹ 8000/- max ₹ 10999
5962,0,AMAZON service is Superb. Lenovo K8 Note is an average product. There is no inbuilt GALLERY in it and there is no MORE RINGTONE OPTIONS of our choice other than inbuilt Ringtones. I am disappointed by purchasing this mobile.
5963,0,1)charging issue taking 15 hours for full charging2) music button working as simultaneously3)touch performance low4)fast discharging not worth of 4000mah
5964,0,"the built quality is good and also the texture is fine. but the main problem is the phone is lagging little bit and the dual camera(depth mode) isn't good.Now come to the point- 1) LAGGING ___ the phone start to lag after the first boot up. when i was doing multitasking the phone start to lag. the phone is running on Android v7.1.1 Nougat operating system with 2.3GHz Helio X23 10-core processor and 4GB-64GB of ram though the phone is lagging so much.Now come to the second point 2) CAMERA____ the front facing camera is good and the back camera is also good but the dual camera mode, i mean the depth mode is very bad, the dual camera couldn't recognise the item that's why it blurs the whole item and its the biggest problem in this phone though they are providing us a DSLR-like depth-of-field effect. One camera has a 13 MegaPixel PureCel Plus sensor, bringing in high-end imaging capabilities. The other has a 5 MegaPixel sensor, which simultaneously captures depth information. This means you can view real-time bokeh with up to F/1.2."
5965,1,Excellent product by Lenovo.4GB RAM 64 GB ROM - enough as per my requirement.Camera is good. Picture Quality is Good.Sound Quality is also good.Battery life is Ok.No problem with the phone as of now.

6072,0,"This phone is hyped as a decacore high performing phone but in reality my old K5 Note is faster. Two major problems that I noticed so far - audio on bluetooth breaks up very frequently and this is not isolated to my phone - do a quick search on Lenovo forums and you'll see that this bug is in every K8 Note and Lenovo hasn't bothered to fix this. Also, if you plan to screencast - you're in for a surprise. This feature isn't there and you'll need chromecast to screencast - Lenovo says that this is as per design. This is not because of a hardware limitation. Some people have enabled this feature by rooting their phone and adding some 3 lines of code which lenovo can add easily, only because Google wants to promote chromecast, this has been removed."

6206,0,Mobile is bit bulky and heavy. No backlit for the navigation icon on screen. It would be better if it is slightly slim.

I have contacted Amazon Customer care regarding this and they said that, their Tech person will visit me and look into this. Their Tech person contacted me over phone and requested IMEI number....That's it....No other communication from them. I strictly advise you my friends., Don't go for this item.

Facing issues with battery performance after available update of Oreo (android 8.0) . Battery charging is taking a lot of time , in 1 hour there is only 10% charging for phone. The drain time is drastically more in comparison to charge time."
6266,1,Processor is quite powerful which does great job and phone doesn't hang even on heavy usage but down side is it consumes more battery which feels 4000 mah as 'Ok' option rather than great. Camera quality is good. Overall deserves 5 star.

6423,0,This mobile is bad
6424,0,First time very bad experience with lenovo. Bad display quality no gorilla glass protection scratches coming on display.. and important app are missing like gallery and many more...I'm boycotting Lenovo.
6425,0,"This is the first time I am reviewing a mobile as I wanted to help the others before buying this phone. This phone is good for a budget of 14k, I have bought 64gb, 4gb ram model. After a week usage I see the Ram speed, browsing net, switching to different apps is really fast. No doubt the interface on Android ver7, it's a great user experience. But there is a major problem with the battery as plenty of them have mentioned on their comments. Lenovo claims it is turbo charging but it takes minimum of 2 hours to charge or sometimes it varies,, close to 3 hours as well. Battery draining quickly is a terrible product defect. I have an issue when the battery indicator level comes to 15%, it goes to 2% in less than 3 minutes and it shuts down. I have highlighted the issue with a video evidence to Amazon and fighting for a replacement of phone or refund, not sure if the same battery issue repeats to my replacement phone as well. I am also planning to post a video of this issue in YouTube. In general a 4000 mah capacity battery should stand for at least 2 days with a minimum usage or 1.5 days with a decent usage, but seeing the comments from most of buyers, I think this is a manufacturing defect and lenovo should really see this issue, get it addressed immediately. If you ask my opinion, wait for few days, revisit the new comments posted by the buyers and once the battery issue stands resolved, then go for it. End of the day what's the point of buying a mobile with a battery issues? it's like buying a vehicle with fuel injection issues,, it will not last long!"

6505,0,"I was using lumia 730 and wanted to switch to an Android phone at last.I chose this phone based on the hype and the specs it comes with.Overall the phone is good but I felt whatever was promised on it's ad by Lenovo wasn't there in real. The phone is laggy even in normal usage quite a few times despite the hype of it 10 core processor. Not good for high end games I mean I use normal games like 8ball pool and this phone couldn't even run that game smoothly and felt glitches and lags every time during the gameplay and spoiled the experience of it. My iPhone 4s plays better 8ball pool better then this phone.Being a normal user I ignored it and now let's talk about the camera. The shutter speed of clicking the pictures is the worst I have seen and the quality of pictures isnt that great, It felt like a high end VGA camera and the panorama pictures are the WORST - WORST.I don't know what the YouTube reviewers saw in it for their biased reviews.2 stars from my side for it."

6584,0,I am writing this review after using almost 10 months. Before I was using Moto G2 which was good but became old and slow overtime. Then I wanted to buy better phone with good camera. The specs of Lenovo K8 Note tempted me to buy mainly duel camera and fast charging. I was expecting better camera phone but disappointed a bit and could not achieve my goal :( Overall phone rating is average.
6585,0,Defective product provided by Amazon
6586,0,"I am posting this review after a week of usage.First of all lots of people problem is to go with this one or Redmi note 4 . So I have used both the device . The only difference between this one and rn4 is battery backup . You'll get around 8 hours of sot in rn4 but only around 5 to 6 hours in k8 note.Other than that all the aspects are definitely better in k8 note. And there is also fast charging in this one which charges fully in 2 hours without using the device if you are using then definitely charging will be much slower.If we consider k8 note alonePros areDual camera (If only there is an update in future to improve)Fast chargingDisplay (All mobiles in this price segment maybe fhd. But this one is slightly better)Dolby AtmosStock Android Superb fluidity (Definitely Lenovo done a great job by removing their ui and goes with stock)Theatre max ( If u are person who is watching lots of Hollywood movies this is best feature)Cons areI experiencing Heating issue while charging and playing (But not too much I think it's manageable)Difference in battery backup ( sometimes I'm getting 6 hours of sot and sometimes around 4 to 5 hours ..But I suggest you to install Greenify for more better battery backup)Unwanted second camera if there is no further updates for cameraThose are the cons I found till nowFinally there are the problems like camera and battery but those can be solved via OTA so I am eagerly waiting for updates.For 14k I'll definitely suggest this one over rn4 , Moto g5 plus and Honor 6x.Im disappointed now that is more than a month no proper update for camera and battery backup is getting worse...so i suggest u guys to ignore this one"

6659,0,"This Lenovo product is just WORST AND BOGUS PRODUCT being cheap.-No UI support. So many features are missing.-No Gallery. No option to store contacts in device memory. For all you have to use Google's Photos, Google's Contacts, which may not be safe.-sys update is available. But when you first try to update, it update and update and update for so many times (not data speed issue) for various versions of update.-So Called 13+5MP dual back camera and 13MP front facing camera are useless!-The so called 4000mAH battery does not lasts longer with very normal usage. no videos games etc. Who has opened the non-removable and seen whether it is a 4000mAH.NEVER BUY THIS MOBILE PHONE."

6666,1,Phone Is Awesome... Work's very smoothly....But it takes time to boot..... Both Cameras are perfect... In 14k its mind blowing.....

6701,0,Very problematic phone......does heating ishue
6702,0,"I am posting this review after 3 months of usage.Initially the phone looked good, but as i started using i found many problems.1. If you go to contacts and click on any contact the screen goes blank and you cant open the contact.2. Mirroring function is not there, so if you want to do mirroring on your TV or projector its not possible3. Bluetooth doesnt work, the phone is not searchable by any other bluetooth device or it cant search any active bluetooth device4. Camara is ok nothing great to have duar camara at the back, and front camara has average result.5. Charging takes long time in some sockets, dont know why.6. Front sensorts are not that great.My overall verdict is if you can get a better option at this price then go for it."
6703,0,"The phone's primary camera is poor, after the snap is clicked the photos look dull, the phone does not come with call recording feature inbuilt as well as third party app only records self voice. The phone is not worth the price is neither comparable to REDMI NOTE 4"

6713,1,Good phone but camera isnt too good so better go for new phones k8 is old already
6714,0,"Pros:Good display, speaker, battery life,camera.Split screen is interesting but several apps are not supported on it.Cons: No earphones in the box. Turbo charger takes up to 45 mins to fully charge the phone as opposed to advertised 15 mins.Good for users who are looking for budget phones with good camera and using it for organising their work etc.The lack of earphones makes it not so enjoyable for watching movies , videos- inspite of a good display."
6715,0,Not worth of it's money
6716,0,"Don't buy. This phone has heating issue. Try Ur luck if u want and may be this works good for u. Amazon return policy is very bad for mobile device. Once u complain for defective product, they will block Ur number and u won't be able to call them again for replacement or refund. U will have to write mails for which no revert will come. In return option they will ask to install an app which will always tell that Ur phone is ok. My sincere suggestion is that don't buy from Amazon any mobile device. I appreciate Flipkart or snapdel as they return without any question if Ur product is not good. My phone touches 40degree when I start taking and they since the temperature is less than 48 it's ok for use. Nonsense."

Phone battery becomes warm when you charge and it took 2hrs to charge 80%. I don't know what they mean by turbo charging if it takes 2hrs. Also while browsing, battery becomes warm.. display is not catchy and look average mobilemlGood thing is that it's latest Android version mobile, and look wise good.

6811,0,"Bad experience, Battery decharging quickly and it takes too much time to charge"
6812,0,Phones are getting slimmer but bend are not covered in warrenty.After using the phone for 4 months a huge bend occur in the handset but service center saying bend problem is not covered in warrenty hence cannot help.So my question is for Lenovo why company is making thinner mobiles with big screen if customer are facing this type of problem and if company will continue doing so the bend problem should also covered in warrenty.Bad experiance.More over my vol. - button stoped working and after rushing to service center i come to know that it get broken and service center denied to replace the same in warrenty and giving bull shit reason that its damage hence not covered in warrenty.So my question is what is covered in warrenty?I could have give .5 stars if option available.Think 1000 times before buying Lenovo product because there was lots of people like me struglling to get their mobiles repaired under warrenty.
6813,1,Awesome phone... reasonable and effective. I alwaz recommend this product.
6814,0,Huge network issue with this model
6815,0,Dont look for hardware but software version used by Lenovo on this K8 Note model is worst. This software has lack basic functionalities like Theme and other basic features you can find in Samsung. Even cast option is not working. Defect in the latest operating system. No change in handling this mobile even K4 Note is better than K8 Note. I have upgraded this mobile to latest Nogut os version 7.1.1 but no help and future version 8.0 Oreio will available in next Diwali 2018. So there is no effort by LENOVO. Worst quality product by Lenovo. Better to go for Samsung
6816,0,Performance not as expected. Lots of bugs for blutooth. many times hangs while playing games. Less frequent updates. Screen burning is another issue.
6817,0,"Dont buy this phone from amazon.after purchaseing a lot of problem occured like battery back up too weak,heating issue not solved and headphone not support.I had mailed on amazon with service report card but no helpful reply from them.they do not return/replace this item.too much worst experience from amazon.never purchase electronic items like mobile or tablet from amazon."
6818,1,"Good battery performance. Delivers a full day of duty for a relatively high usage of mail box, net usage, and social surfing. Response of the OS and equipment is in line with the expectation. Speakers are good. After the stunning results I get on my MotoZ, it is only natural that I do. It find the results of the camera in line with my expectation ! Overall, a fantastic value for money !"

6896,0,Its heating like hell. don't buy it. Lenovo should need improvement. Hanging issues. Camera is like I'm using MP camera. Battery draining fast. I loved previous Lenovo's K4 note phone before but now they changed their product's quality. Also their Service centre's staff are not professional. They don't have even basic Knowledge about possible issues in phones and they compare service with Samsung and Iphone. Lol..

When I visited customer service center, they informed me as there is a display problem, you have to pay 5,000 for repairing. This means that the phone was defective which Amazon supplied to me."
7067,0,"1. Though advertised as Jio compatible being LTE, does not WORK with Jio Sim. most of the time. We have made 3 visits to Jio and after that, sometimes it works, sometimes not. Sometimes Jio calls work, sometimes JioNET sometimes neither! You want a phone with 2 sims and it should be dependable, but not this one. You cannot trust it and take it with you and be sure that you can make/receive a call when you want it.2. Turbo charging does not work - of course with the charger and the cable provided3. Heats up quite a lot. Gets very hot even when not in use.Recommendation: DO NOT BUY TILL Lenovo FIXES THESE."

7160,0,"Good phone but bit overpriced. Internet is full of reviews and specs so will not repeat it. Following is the list of pros and cons from myside.Cons :-1) Gets warm while playing simple games like Candy crush tho no problem watching videos and listening to music.2) Personally I didnt find Stock android OS that great. I am in favour of few customization and features options from manufaturer. Customization options are very limited. Major put off for me.3) Unread message badge counter for notification is missing. So if ur phone is on silent and u hv disabled notification u wont b able to know how many messages are unread in whatsapp, sms, facebook etc. You hv to manually open the each app and check the status now and then.4) No separate option for monitering Call and Message notifications Ringtone. If u lower or mute call ringtone message tone would also be reduced or mute as the case may be.5) No ultra power saving mode option.6) No NFC, Infrared, IR Blaster and Screen mirror options7) Key board typing is not so smooth and lot of time i hv to edit wht i keep typing at high speed8) Double tap to wake phone takes time9) Battery hogging. Even being 4000 mph battery it runs out in 7-8 hours flat compared to Redmi Note 4 which gives more than a day battery life10) Very heavy n bulky. Feels like u r carrying a small iron rod in the pocket.Pros:-1) Blazing fast speed to open and manage all apps2) Premium Look with all metal finish3) Display panel excellent4) No hybrid sim slot. Means u can use 2 sims and one memory card5) Good RAM management6) Dedicated music key with customization optionPersonally I would not recommend this pure stock android phone to anyone. Better options like Redmi Note 4, Moto G5 + with similar specs available."

7163,1,Guys i am an engineer so writing this review after long study. Phone hardware is absolutely awesome. However this is stock Android so you can't expect extra.

The same sim card works fine on Redmi note 4 and Mi 4i.Lenovo works only when manually select 2G which is pathetic.Amazon Blancco diagnostic app says everything is fine but photo inbuilt status shows no signal.it show 0signal strength.Amazon is fooling customer. After a huge fight I got my phone replacement but they didn't provide refund. Now with replacement phone it doesn't provide option to refund or further replacement. You are only lucky 1 time if your phone is damaged or doesn't work.Lenovo must provide fix and Amazon must improve on customer service.

I am going to return it??3.Sometime, While Some incoming Phonecall is ringing or am watching some vdo, it made a craking sound like crack bell is ringing for 20/30 seconds and vdo stops/ Incoming ring stops , I get puzzled what to do, then it Restarts on its own.4.The volte sign euivallent special lenovo K8 style that hand phone picture with 4G written on top vanishes 2/3 times a day, but after again Restarting it comes back...5. Battery charging in Device Power off condition...in last 5/6 days for 5/6 times (4000mah Doesn't last full 1 day also)took 2 hours 30 minutes to 2 hours 41 minutes...What type of fast / Turbo charging is this??6. Google Contact Back up is not working at al, So Back Up & Reset part is useles in Setting, Google photo showing date as 29 Nov 2201.....but taking photo back ups.7.Severe Network Problem.Camera is so so..Not so great , not so bad not so good as hyped in their advt. And tell you the truth I didnt face much Heating problem in this 8 days before Retun.Taken to Lenovo service center, shown the problems, they said to Return immidiately, Faulty set.Adding again on 14/09/17......After clicking return button and following the Proper returning Procedures (where you really need to apply your brain, dont just click here and there like a fool, then will face much problem for return and Refund, like many facing as per the reviews) on 12th Night, An Amazon Techinician came to my house to inspect the phone and found that its really faulty, left a copy of inspection report with me, and within 10 mnts after he left my home, got a call from Amazon, asking what I want Replacement or Refund ??? Mad or what?? Again same K8 Note..Pagal hai keya....asked for a Refund....Pick up scheduled fixed today 10-1pm......Pick up boy came at 1:25Pm....3:30pm My money is in my Bank....WWWW OOOO WWWW what a Fantastic 10********** Star service from Amazon.....Flipkart-wala wont Refund you untill the Shipper confirms that the goods rec'd in good condition....takes about 10 working days since the Return packet leaves your Home.NO STAR FOR LENOVO K8 NOTE, don't waste your money, although it was my dream set........10 STAR FOR AMAZON CUSTOMER SERVICE."

7391,1,It's a great phone.
7392,0,"With lot of expectations went for the phone.The finish was so good and it was light weight. The android 7 was neat and the phone. Didn't face any lagging or heating during my initial use.The disappointment was more on the turbo charging and especially on the camera. The turbo charging was not as quick as I had expected so that was a bit disappointing. Still a decent speed and we can live by it.The camera experience was one of the worst that I have come across in the five years. I am not sure if it was a bad piece I received or k8 note itself is of such low quality. In past I have used nexus 5, meizu note 2, Redmi note 3 and Moto g4 plus and when compared to those mobiles the camera specifications were a bit high in this. One of the major reasons I went for this one was for the camera specs it boasted of. Sadly all pics either in depth mode, hdr, or even normal mode were of very very low quality. I would rate the camera 1/10.If you are not worried about the camera then you can go for it. I have returned my phone alreadyP.S: Again I am not sure if my piece was a fault one but as far as my experince goes this is a total waste of money purely for the worst camera experince."

7450,0,I have purchased Lenovo K8 note. This product is really disappointed me it is missing the basic CAST future. Even 4000 rupees mobile is having this feature but Lenovo is missing this Basic concept. They are suggesting to purchase a chromecast to Cast the screen. it is not worth because recently every TV is coming with the smart future with advanced features in built for the casting. Lenovo has to take it on priority and need to release the update. With out cast feature this mobile is really waste of money and better to choose other mobile.
7451,0,"This has no recorder. Worse, it doesn't have the facility for even a third party, two-way recording App which I require for professional work. Why couldn't this company even mention that it doesn't have a recorder like it's previous products ? Felt cheated."

7559,0,"What I didn't like :This cell phone was running smooth till the time I started getting updates.After the recent updates , specially after theAndroid 8.0 , i.e. The Oreo updateThis model has come up with so many problems1. CALL CONNECTIVITY : I ain't able to talk to someone on calls properly as it starts loosing the connectivity , or rather it'll be like , I'm able to hear the person in talking to but the person on the other side isn't able to hear anything I say ..its got so bad that every time I call someone up they hang up saying ""bro I'm not able to hear u rn , I'll call u back later .""2. HEATING ISSUES : you know what's the amazing part ..this cell phones gets heat up ...even when its not in use ""woooww!""I'm tried of this Heating issue , it gets to level where u can't , literally... hold your cell...3. HANGING ISSUES: This cell has got me so crazy coz it hangs every now and then and lags performance ..They talk abt the high end processor in this cell ..I guess its ""just on paper"" stuff , and m not even able to use two app together , like Instagram and what's app .And if I switch to musically or Snapchat , this cell just hates me then and goes black , ""i guess gotta talk to my cell abt it and settle it ! , Ryt!?""4. CAMERA : (I guess I'll end up listing all the aspects of this cell , anyway )Camera in this cell phone is GOOD , trust me on that , but it is when it wishes to be .Low light photographs are terrible.It keeps on loosing focus , every time.It sometimes doesn't even start up .. And then i have to reboot it...5. VIDEO / PICTURE QUALITY : This cell phone's video quality is too bad ...while u take it ...you'll feel it's good , but when u save it and seeIt's all noisy and full of glitches""As if I don't have sufficient net and m seeing a YouTube video on 144 or 240 pixels""6. BATTERY LIFE : ( okay I'll stop on this point , coz honestly I never wrote such big reviews )So ... Battery life of this cell is pathetic guys ,Its so bad ..that it just lasts for 2 hrs 30 mins '80%' in use ....I can't even carry it without a power bankCoz this cell looses its life so quick.On the standby mode itself .If I had an option of time and availability of cell phone (as my cell is already dead , loosing 56% of its battery in 1hr 15mins , and all I was using is a fitness app ) to attach few pictures of the section where battery usage is displayed ( I forgot what it's called ) I would've shown u the standby usage ... It's first in my ""major"" usage list using 55% of life....Battery life is the major issue I face rn , coz I don't play games and .. now I don't feel social sites that imp that they become my priority so when it gets heat up or lags / hangs I keep it aside and study or do somethin else , but calls and emergency texts or something imp need to be given priority ryt? But this cell doesn't allow me to take it as it's already displaying ""battery saver mode on""*sigh .If you'll did read this wholeeee thing , thanks Nd I'm sorry I don't have the time to write down abt the good things in this cell phone , I'm sure you'll find many other sources to find that out .FEW GOOD THINGS ARE:* If u know how to use your frnd (cell) it takes amazing pictures in day light , I love taking pictures though ..and this cell is way better than most other cell phones out there* It's performance (before the update) was amazing and smooth I was able to switch between real quick . Again. ..better than most other phones* And many other stuff ...So I rated it three coz it's eventually lacking everything , ""but I love my cell phone"" 😂I mean .. ik this cell is really good it's just the unstable updates that have ruined it ."

7605,0,"The 3.5 mm Jack delivers so low sound... The Dolby Atmos is useless coz of it... The phones good but Lenovo seriously needs to get killer notes software updates for headphone jack volume. And it's not the headset issue. I am using a sound magic. Similar issues experienced by people using boat, jbl, 💀 candy. It's all over Lenovo forum's but they aren't paying no heed"

7625,0,"I bought this as I wanted to get upgraded from Mi Note 3 { my version was 3GB/32GB }This is a disappointment as I expected a robust device with Helio and 4GB RAM. I didn't liked the stock android too. May be I am used to MIUI version of android.Cons :1. Apps getting slow while using2. Stock SMS app is fail as it doesn't group #notifications like MIUI does. There is no copy OTP option.3. No screenshot button on the drag down menu from top4. Battery isn't great although I am not a gaming enthuPros:1. Only one , that's listening to music thru dolby atmos* Don't buy this if you are already using Xoami / Vivo / Oppo / CoolPad types. This is a useless piece of mobile"
7626,0,"At first i would like to thank amazon for taling back this product. This mobile is an unmarked product with hitension issues or in other words its like expected a ton received a corn and again its not sweet corn.I would like to advise smart buyers that display over the screen and display after taking pics and videos recorded have a vast difference, as many said that amazing crystal clear display.Camera fearures have given a tight slap to buyers and video recording has smacked every ones head down. Its like recording with 2 Mp basic hand set.I wish i can put more comments, since i got my refund i am tight lipped now..Wont be trusting lenovo here after.Actually one should appreciate the video director for making all those random experiences that neither works nor responds..Regret & regards."
7627,0,Camera quality is very poor. Picture ko joom karne par dhundli ho jati hai.. or ek network security dusre network me Jane par network search karvana padta hai..Varna outgoing or incoming band ho jati hai..

7629,0,"1. They are no call recorder2. Network poor if handset not detected network mobile factory reset network works normally.3. Casting didn't work.I'm already used k4,k5 but k8 is worst experience."
7630,1,Best mobile in this price range. Bye Bye to all issues that irritated us in other android devices. Google photos is very slow in copy/cut and pasting files on to memory card and is failing quite often in simple cut/ copy paste function which I am sure can be corrected in future updates. Overall a fantastic mobile.

7688,0,There is no Auto Call recording option as in previous version. There is no separate gallery. Double depth camera is not up to the level. Lots of improvement required.
7689,1,"I really liked the sound quality of the device. It’s a little heavier than I expected. The dual camera usage is not as accurate as I thought it would be. The depth is not very pronounced. But it does give a good picture quality.Overall, a good buy in its price range."
7690,1,As it is Dolby Atmos the speakers should be in upper n bottom like Lenovo k4.

7692,1,Nice
7693,0,"I highly recommend not to buy this. Lenovo let itslf down by not checking the phone before launching. Battery draining like hell, bluetooth connectivity is a problem. Software has bugs, not able to recieve calls sometyms. I have to press power button twice to make screen work to recueve calls. Dual camera which lenovo says is a forte is not having enough features to even compete with other lower end single camera phones. I am trapped, not received the update yet. And amazon will not take back the product once bought until u have physical damage."
7694,1,I like the material quality & picture quality
7695,0,After orieo update .phone is hanging a bit and charging is drain very quickly .

The first two bought a month and two month back were made in China 😔 and the one bought yesterday was only made in India. So depressed and confused. Why the other two were made China 😢Should I raise a complaint against Amazon or Lenovo ?"

7706,1,Super
7707,1,Earphone not received
7708,0,"I would have happily given a 4* rating had it not been for the atrocious delivery quality of Amazon.Positives:- It has a premium look and feel, and good build quality.- Setting up was easy.- Battery life is quite good, with more than 1 day for my normal usage.- Display quality is very good.- Both front and rear cameras are reasonably good for the average user. Read negatives below.- Split screen feature with two apps running at the same time is useful for people who really need it. Otherwise a novelty.- Flash can be turned on in video recording, which is another novelty with no significant improvement in video brightness except a drain on the battery.Negatives:- Lenovo claims turbo-charging, but with the standard micro-USB port and the charger provided, charging is not very fast. It took about 90 minutes to charge from 15% to full. Would hardly qualify as 'turbo'.- The Nougat OS provided is stock android with very little customisation possibilities, so may not be liked by users who are used to heavy UIs on other phones - but once you get used to it you will start accepting it.- The bokeh effect with dual rear camera is just so-so, and many times the layer separation is not as precise as you expect it to be, so you will not get desired results everytime. Also, when you turn on the dual camera, the front layer is also slightly out of focus. On the whole, you can forget that you have dual rear cameras, and stick to single camera mode for peace of mind.- Missing 'slow-motion' and 4K recording are a shame. Panorama mode does not even cover 180 degrees.Overall good value for money. Go for it if you want performance and not care for camera features."
7709,1,Over all It's a very good device .But battery is some what
7710,0,DO NOT buy this product. Despite of good hardware configuration this mobile fail to provide basic features. Camera do not focus on particular object after tapping. The much talked dual camera captures photo with very little blureness which looks too artificial as if edited in cheap photo editing software. Battery drains too quickly. Stock android is too much overloaded with google ads. So even if ur mobile is screen locked video and other ads keep playing and generates sound. Brightness fail to lower its intensity in dark. You can not cast the device screen on TV as it fails to detect the TV. Even from the video player you can not cast the screen. This device do not provide that feature.

7771,1,Good mobile for the rate
7772,0,Very bad product I bought before 3 months hundred percent network issue very bad product no customer service solo my problem
7773,1,Bought in January so writing review after 5 months... I got this phone for 11k in some offer...At this price I think it's quite worthy product.1. Camera quality is excellent but if you're comparing with DSLR or other costly phone than you may be disappointed.2. Speed is fine... Unless you don't ask for lighting speed..3. Gaming .. well I played both offline and online games it's doing pretty well.4. Speaker and sounds both are doing well till date.Cons.1. Yup battery heats sometime but that's not the phone problem as I have noticed ... It's due to network fluctuations and sometimes if you talk while charging ..So you can go for it as it's a budget phone ..I'm a moderate user of all the facilities.
7774,0,"my honest review after using it for 6 months.1. The processor is too worst, booting of mobile takes 2-3 minutes and always shows an error message, you can't even play small games like subway surfers without struck, you can clearly see a lag in frames.2. It doesn't have Turbo Charging, it takes 1hr 20mins for a full charge. mobiles with turbo charge will take 40mins. It failed in this aspect also.3. Sometimes mobile will auto restart.4. As a usual overheating problemIn future, I won't recommend Lenovo for my friends"

7796,0,Mainly I got this phone for it's Dolby Atmos and was curious to hear my favorite tracks. But the audio level is so damn low that even my old Moto g (1st Gen ) sounds 100 times better than this. Also battery is draining so damn badly. Camera is decent. Performance wise it's good for it's money. Also the network keeps fluctuating. Planning to return the phone if there is no update for it's volume defect.

Just an another note serious from Lenova, the specification looks great on paper and in reality everything sucks.It gets heated up even for normal usage, the battery drains faster than normal mobiles, it is not a 4000mah battery for sure.The camera looks good not better. Don't zoom it while taking long shots. Th picture quality is not up to the mark.It does not behave like 4gb ram, it rather responds like 2gb ram and gets jammed frequently.I have installed many apps and after getting the phone slowed down, I have removed most of the aps.Guys, the price was reduced but still, you shall go for a better brands like Moto, mi, Samsung."

8449,0,"Worst Product from Lenovo till date. The hand set has issues from the date of purchase. Issues faced are as under and can be an eye opener for the prospective buyers:1. Hang-up during usage - very often you are left stranded in between apps as phone hangs-up in between usage like checking whatsapp, email of sms2. Heats up excessively - The claim of fast charging is false. it takes almost 5 hours for full charge. Heats up even while making calls and drains battery quite fast. The battery doesn't last even 5 hours post full charge3. Battery - The claim on turbo charge is false. There is no fast charging and it takes 5-6 hours for full charge. Heats up even while making calls and drains battery quite fast. The battery doesn't last even 5 hours post full charge4. Access to common functions - Doesn't even have access to common functions like providing SMS service centre number. Have recently taken the handset to a lenovo service centre, even they didn't know, how to put in the sms service centre number.5. Lenovo Forum - Unlike other leading or even lesser known brands, Lenovo executives don't respond to the queries/issues put up on the forum.Over all very bad product to choose. My issue how to dispose the same.regardsCertified buyer"

8454,0,"The Phone display got damaged within 7 months of usage and the service center has declined the warranty stating there is an internal damage to the display. I asked them to open the phone and show the internal damage to that I can accept their statement, for which they are not ready. They say even if they open they can't show the damage. Even after escalating the issue, the issue is not resolved and they are not ready to honor the warranty. Better to go for accidental damage coverage if you are going with this phone."

8457,0,"Guys This phone is superior in hardware buylt its software has major shortcomings. Lenovo K3/K4 users should not buy this phone considering the performance of those phones. The software part misses some functions which makes it an below average phone for day to day use :Con's- Phone's design is rectangular so it does not fits perfectly in hand and feels heavier- No option to save contacts in phone memory , Only gmail a/c contacts support which makes contacts and call logs and messages laggy. It lags wherever you require to get contact from contacts.- Their is no option to disable vibration on call connect- Its mono loud speakers sound is loud but quality is like cheap chinese phone ,Its not like k3 - k4 notePro's- Good battery backup - 4 star for it- Screen resolution, colors & touch screen is very smooth - 5star for them- Good Processor works faster and better. But phones seems laggy due to poor hardware software coordinationI will not recomend to buy this phone, instead go for samsung phones as their software is always balanced"

But after using for months, I just regret buying it. Battery does not last for more than 5-6 hours, keeps on hanging and takes a lot time in saving pics. Being 64 gb and decacore, it was supposed too run smoothly, but it's a waste piece. My sony M2 phone was much better than this. Even after using for four years, runs perfectly. Never buy Lenovo phones."

8546,1,"Good phone bad camera, great performanceI'm not one to write lengthy reviews of products, but here I felt the need to get a few points out there, because the Lenovo K8 Note isn't all that it promises to be, but it's definitely not an average product either.Point is, I bought this phone to replace my Redmi Note 3, 3GB and 32GB. I have an S7 Edge as my primary driver, I've always kept a second phone to game and watch videos. The other options I had considered were the Honor 6X and The Honor 8 Lite. The reason I went with Lenovo K8 note was for the dual camera setup and a good industry reviews on performance. It wouldn't hurt that my backup phone had a dual camera setup to play around with some bokeh fun. Here's my thoughts after using the phone as my primary phone for the past 3 days.Performance:This phone is everything that every review claims it to be. Yes it has a Mediatek processor but this deca-core setup with 4GB ram and 64Gb memory is phenomenal. In my experience, this phone handles multi-tasking as good as my S7 edge. I was playing Guns Of Boom, WWE Champions, YouTube video and Facebook all at the same time, and over a period of 45 minutes, the phone switched between these apps without a single glitch or delay. WWE Champions was open when I locked my phone. When I picked it back up afetr 20 odd minutes, I found the screen exactly where I left and it loaded the game without a seconds delay. If you want this phone for casual gaming and media, its just a pleasure to use.Camera:In all fairness, the dual camera setup on the K8 note requires a lot of polishing. Its nowhere near as good as the Honor 6X. The depth detection feature is very erratic. It works like a charm under good and day light, but try using it indoors and in the evening you'll either be left with hazy photos lacking sharpness or pictures that have been focused in the wrong areas. The front 13 MP camera is good for casual selfies though.One thing though, put the flash on and both the front and the back cameras return stellar results. The bokeh effects and the depth editor functions may not work as well as they should, but if you manage to keep a steady hand and get a good shot from the dual camera setup, then playing around with the options can be fun. Changing background and focus are fun options. (Check photos)Battery, UI, Build and valueThe battery backup is great to say the least. I tested it by playing a graphic intensive Modern Combat 5 for 2.5 hours straight and the battery dropped from 100 to 50. The casual day with some gaming, social media and calling etc takes the phone to 30-20 per cent max by 12 in the night.The phone comes with a clear / transparent plastic case installed on the phone. Since there aren't any good choices for a K8 note cover, this preinstalled one serves the purpose, but it is scratch prone. Just the second day it had dozens of scratches. (Check the photo)The all metallic build of the phone looks and feel very premium. The black colour has a nice matte finish too. But the back love fingerprints and gets a smudge very easily. (Check photo) Its best to use a black armour / cover when they become available.The best part of the K8 note is the stock android UI. That ensures the K8 note is smooth and perfectly functional. Its a snappy phone alright. The finger print sensor works like a charm on both hands, it picks up even the most obscure touches.Final Word:I would definitely recommended the k8 note. In terms of sheer performance, this phone is a pleasure. Its like a tuned up KTM engine. It may not have the most appeasing specs but the performance is all throttle and torque friendly. Sadly, the camera is below average to be frank. Either Lenovo push through some tuneups or the buyers will have to keep their photography ambitions under a strict check."

8678,0,"The mobile has some good features. But charging is very slow. (Nearly 4 hours) Initially there were problems with VOLTE (JIO) connectivity. Jio was good for internet, but calls and messaging did not work on this handset. The same jio sim worked well in another 4G handset. With software update, this issue The camera doesn't start sometimes and I had to restart the mobile. Restarting this mobile also takes a long time compared to other mobiles. Lenovo has to seriously fix these issues."
8679,0,"My experience with this phone has been mixed. The good thing about the phone is the 1080p resolution. The videos look crisp, so you can watch youtube , netflix , prime and enjoy the visuals.The sound is not loud enough, even adding a headphone does not help much, unless it has an amplifier. You will have problems while receiving calls because the incoming volume is low. I called up the customer case and they asked me to do a factory reset. Did not help.The touch screen gets laggy after some time.I have enough spare storage and even when no apps are running, I can feel the lag. Another irritation is while holding the phone the touchscreen gets touched and results in unintentional clicks."

No auto-brightness option. 55 - 60% RAM is always occupied no matter whatever I do to clear it and the phone lags even in simple games like Subway Surfers.With all the features advertised and at this price range, it is frustrating."
8689,1,Worth it. Aug 2017- best config on this date for this price
8690,0,The battery Performance of the mobile is like 2500mah capacity.. screen on time is just average (4hrs)... rear camera is good and selfie camera tooo good... performance is excellent.. dolby atmos is average.
8691,1,Nothing in particular
8692,0,"such a waste of money....don't buy this handset, i'm trying to return this...."

8696,1,Cash back not credited for this purchase yet. Product is good.
8697,1,In this mobile the gorilla Glass is duplicate after some time use purchase date 24/01/2018 glass is broken on corner side
8698,1,"Liked the product. Amazing features, seamless performance, Good build quality and most important reasonably priced."
8699,1,Best phone I have ever had
8700,0,lenovo k8 having turbo chargingBut it works automatically sometime it’s charge in 1.25 hrs and sometime it take more than 2 hrs..Heavy weight of 180 grmPerformance of rear camera is not too much good in low light conditions and Rear Camera performance also one problem sometime you will see blurred images no subject is in focus.and one main disadvateage is battery is draining fast cannot use one day full .. Bettery choise is any other phone very bad
8701,0,Not upto the mark
8702,0,Not satisfied with it's performance.Hanging is the Big Disadvantage of this phone...
8703,0,phone is very good but data cable is very bad quality
8704,0,"Network not good, sim is not working properly.Mobile have no eye protection.Without eye protection screen light is bad for eye"
8705,1,Super nice
8706,1,NYC phone
8707,1,"Great experience with this amazing product from Lenovo.it is equipped with almost every features that a smartphone would require.decacore processor,long lasting battery and 64 kB internal memory with 4gb ram is just awesome.i would certainly recommend this phone for users having heving usage and game lovers."
8708,1,Osm mobile...
8709,0,4*deducted due tovvery poor battery performance... drains in 2.5hrs... Only...
8710,0,"Got the device yesterday.From first charge itself the charger makes loud hissing noise continuously during charging this device, but no noise while charging other devices. Similarly no noise comes when charged this device using another charger. Now I'm using the old lenovo charger instead of the new one.#2 Many software issues :Dolby atmos is not working.Clock is not getting updated while on call.Sometimes native app itself opens twice."
8711,1,Camera result is not more expected that I thought..
8712,0,Lenovo k8 note does not seem to support screen cast. You can cast you tube videos but you can't cast Amazon prime videos. The device or the OS seems to have a bug and does not recognize my smart TV when I try to cast. I checked online for solutions and Lenovo says to use Chromecast thus asking us to buy that indirectly. Don't buy this phone. Also it is not taking screenshot even though I tried the steps they have written. Also it doesn't recognize my ear phones which works perfectly with other Lenovo phones. Faulty device. Don't buy.
8713,1,This product is good for use and features are satisfing according to price
8714,1,Overall good phone

8722,0,Battery is draining very poor. After 30% battery mobile will switch off immediately.
8723,0,its battery life is very poor and jio network also not come properly
8724,0,It is not possible to put both the 4G sim cards at a time
8725,1,Everything is great in this phone but problem in doing casting as it does not support screen mirroring but for casting you need a same WiFi network which is connected to your phone and with your smart led tv
8726,1,Battery performance is not up to the mark.

In 64 gb storage u will get only 50gb which is so bad ....."
8762,0,Speaker is useless .
8763,0,Actually I love LenoVo...I have used K5note and impressed. But ki note is not up to the mark.
8764,1,"Excellent phone, all premium features at an affordable price. I got it in just over 9k in Amazon sale 😎"

8770,0,The phone working is fine.. Only turbo charging questionable coz it still takes 2hrs to full charge the phone.. Otherwise 4.5 stars..
8771,1,"Nice mobile with great performance, awesome battery backup and dash charging. The camera quality is also great only want portrait mode as it has dual camera also."
8772,0,"5* for cameras, the cameras are really good the pictures are clear and perfect. Front camera with flash is really a good thing. The depth mode wasn't working perfectly, but after few updates it was rectified.1* for its turbo charging, it takes 2.5 hrs to charge it's battety from 30-100.1* for its volte, does not support jio voice calls. After 2 calls volte wont work.5* for its dolby, it has a very good quality of sound but volume can be improved.4* for its fully metallic body, its quite heavy but good slim attractive look3* for its battery, because for this smartphone 4000mAh is not sufficient.5* for its fingerprint sensor, it is quick in recognising the finger imprints.3* for its processors, processors are good but it takes a little bit of time to load some applications.The main thing which really disappointed me was-does not support Volte(it's 4g volte isn't permanent it's switches on and off whenever the phone wishes. If volte goes off you should restart your phone, again after placing two calls you must again restart to continue voice calls through Volte that is through jio Sim.)-turbocharging does not work, it takes more time to charge.(if you plug in your phone at 30%, to reach 100% it takes at least two hours.)"

8821,0,actually i purchased this product for camera only. but photograph taken by this phone either in day light or low light condition are extremely bad. Whoever purchasing this for camera i will say my experience is not good with this model. Other features are good.
8822,0,Very Unhappy with the phone.Lenovo claims it to have Gorilla glass but its not true. Glass quality is worst than the normal LCD display of a 5000rs range phone. Its 1 month since i bought the phone and the screen cracked when the phone fell from just the dining table.Not happy with the phone.Fake Gorilla Glass. Highly recommended to NOT BUY the phone....

8825,0,"It,s nice one.but software futures need to add more options."
8826,0,Have been using K4 Note for over an year & half. Very satisfied with that. K8 with Nougat OS is marginally better on overall performance but seriously low on user customization. Audio level of speaker and Headphone a big letdown.
8827,1,Awesome
8828,0,"Stay away from this phone, signal quality is not just bad - it is a fail; k-series finally has brought in the disease that finished Motorola; k8 Note says on the back that it is made by Moto Mobility. I have had 3 k3 notes, 2 k4 notes & 1 k5 note; all good phones; k4 note is an excellent phone. this k8 note is crap; i will have to throw it away. It is completely unpredictable with signal reception; strong 3g signal with no data; strong 4g signal and then another minute zero signal; strong signal but bad call quality; i can go on & on; it is a very inconvenient user experience. So k-series legacy has been done with Motorola's legacy of oblivion."
8829,1,A good device in this budget with these specifications

8860,0,"I will never recommend to purchase to Lenovo mobile. I am very flustered about Lenovo product and services. Because I purchased four device of Lenovo k8 Note and all are failed during one month. One goes battery failed, second phone’s Speaker failed, third phone sensor stopped to work, and forth one mic problem. This is first time When I took decision to go out from Apple Samsung and HTC but now seems It was very bad idea to choose other from them. Lenovo failing to provide good device as well service too. They don’t keep any hardware device in advance. They always order new for new complain and give time line upto 3 days but they won’t give you in three days. It will take almost one and half week to resolve issue. They don’t have good product and good service."

8945,0,"My 1st Lenovo mobile let me down with the worst performance. After a long while, I bought this Lenovo k8 note which is also let me down again.1) Deca core processor, but still lags, not fast enough.2) Getting heated up like Iron box while charging. I think one can iron their clothes with this mobile.3) Lenovo still a plenty of work to do to make their mobile phones work better. Even, their Chinese counter parts - Honor & Xiaomi are doing great from their failures/set backs. Lenovo yet to learn that. This mobile has got very good spec., But it's software is not optimised for better performance. As usual, Lenovo lost its basics.4) 4000mAH battery, but it doesn't last for a day after the update (Not Oreo update)There are many issues with this Lenovo mobile. So, as others said, DON'T BUY IT BY SEEING THE SPEC. If you do so, you'll be one among us to worry about your decision about buying this mobile. 👎😕🙁😏😓"

It will drop automatically, i changed sim. Both sim having same problem. So confirmed phone problem. They says this is stock android and we got android update first. We all know new phones are available in market with android oreo os. Our stock android lenovo phone still works with noughgat, no update providing, depth mode is fully waste. The photo looks like we edited in 3rd party application. No originality when we take depth enabled picture. They says an option that we can clear the background color as black and white. Its lie. It has no option for changing background color."

9177,1,Hi
9178,0,Worst ever phone I have come across.Camera quality very poor.Dual camera is only for name. In depth pic blurs the object and background.Bluetooth connectivity is worst. Always breaking when connected to car Bluetooth.Network signal always shows only 1 bar. Download speed is like 2g. It takes hell lot of time to download a simple app in play store.Now Amazon is not refunding it. Feels like cheated after paying so much of money. Totally unsatisfied. Pls don't buy it
9179,0,Ok ok product not good not badBack camera is worked

9183,0,Very very very poor.....camera some times not open it&flashlight....very very wost product my money is waste charing complete hang....not using compatable so sad
9184,0,Don't bye a Lenovo product because company service support not available in Tamil nadu. Any problems in your Lenovo phone. Then ready to expenses minimum 1000 rupees.Also find the service centre location in your Lenovo phone (lenovo help ) . Map showing no any service centre in India.

9201,0,"The phone start responding to random touches without even touching it.And it started happening within 5 minutes of starting to use.The return/replace requests on app/site are of no use.The chat with customer care wasted much time only to be told that i need to call.When called, it again wasted time and then i was connected to phone department.They listened to problem and and put me on hold for 15 minutes.They must be thinking i will disconnecting but i didn't.Anyways after the call resumed, i was told that there is no issue with the phone. They have verified it with EMEI no. Now this is insane.So the next step would be to search for a service centre and get a certificate from them that the phone is defective and then only it can be returned/replaced. All this within 10 days.So much for the famed Amazon Prime service.Its better to visit hot-spot and buy a phone from there. Their service is just amazing."

9277,0,"Hello,The phone starts resetting itself randomly. This issue starts after after 3 days of use, especially when you use it for longer time like watching a you tube video for an hour or two. The issue starts to repeat after 1 or 2 days, then I tried few option mentioned in Lenovo help APP which is pre-installed(I am feeling like a stupid for having done this) , after that for 4 or 5 days it didn't show this issue. Now it back with a bang and almost resets itself every night. Use the phone in night, then lock it and keep aside and when you take the phone again in the morning, boom, it is dead already. And when you manually power-on there is enough juice left in the battery. Not sure what to do with this kind of issue, the phone is absolutely useless.When I approached amazon for return, they are quoting policy and suggest me that I should run pillar to post to get problem rectified (not sure even it is rectifiable issue), The below Amazon's tagline tag-line sounds funny"" Earth's Most Customer-Centric Company."", I am not really sure whether they understood what they really mean, I am already started feeling bitter for my purchase decision in Amazon and now I realized that buying Lenovo brand is same as throwing your money into garbage."

The charger still has 6 months warranty left..!! Selling phones by making false statements..LENOVO sucks.."
9282,0,"I bought this phone with lot of hopes going by the specs described. However, it was a huge disappointment..BIG MISTAKE!. The phone is absolutely rubbish..Blue tooth was not working, Volume and sound output was very poor (considering that lenovo claims those are Dolby stereo), camera was not up-to the mark, display was not abysmal, Colour display was nothing to write home about..All in all it is one HELLUVA DISASTER OF A PHONE...In summary PLEASE DONT BUY..ITS NOT WORTH THE MONEY..i wouldnt pay even 5000K for this!"

I was initiallyvery excited about this mobile but i found it over rated now..Moreover, I guess with the passage of time unfortunately the quality of goods at Amazon is deteriorating day by day.

9347,0,good fone..good camera..but charging takes a lot of time..nd need some software updates ...my old k3note is better and faster than this k8 note
9348,0,"Writing this review after using this mobile for one week.Fast delivery by Amazon and packaging is good.Phone is some what heavy, but still manageable. When i switched on internet it asked for some system updates, before those updates i didn't face much issue with the mobile, but after that update if u charged ur mobile once it reached 100% automatically phone will be switched off. So we can't charge it in the night and have to unplug it before it's reaching 100%.Battery backup is ok. Will last for one day if you didn't play much games. You can't cover the screen entirely by using tempered glass, because of edge design. Charging is taking much time eventhough it's saying it has quick charge option. Earphone is missing in the box. Camera clarity is average. They have opted so many Moto technologies, but still needs to improve a lot.Android 8.0 update will be received on July as per Lenovo. I believe with in that they will launch the next version."

9407,0,"Updated review:I had used Redmi 4A before & never had any network issue with Vodafone. But with this phone., I;m constantly switching from 3G to $g to 3G depending on the area.Battery is draining fast unless you charge it to full for over 3 hrs.Can someone recommend where to buy the orginal fast charger for this? Mine got damaged in the rain.So i have only been using it for less than 24hrs, but here's what all i discovered:-Cons1. Heating issue exists. While i spent time trying to figure out this depth mode, my cam was on for around 15 -20 min with wifi running in the background. The phone started getting warmer in my hand to the point that you could just almost be uncomfortable.2. Slippery back cover-although the phone comes with a transparent hard back cover, it's still a bit slippery. The original cover is like a magnet for patches & sweaty hands do no good to it.3. Battery-when i unboxed the phone(around 6pm) it had some 46% charge already which however lasted only until 12am, 6hours with no gaming or media usage. Surprisingly when the battery alarm went off at 15%, it lasted for just 10 min before shutting down. If 15% charge with low battery mode activated gives me just 10 min, thats really pathetic I'd say. With my Redmi 4A, i used to survive at least an hour with 15% charge. Very disappointed.4. Network issues. I used Vodafone 4G. While mobile data lacked any disruptions in connection, what I found is low voice quality. Even in open spaces, there was loss of voice & the bars for network weren't full.Pros-1. The Dolby Atomos speakers -4/5 would need to figure out how to control the bass etc. Speakers are quite loud though, haven't yet checked with the ringer volume when phone is in pocket.2. Front cam-again excellent. I especially love the flash, which does't give you an ashen look, but colour stays vibrant.3. Depth mode- the bokeh mode does take about 10-15 min of practice to figure out. The after effects like removing background & selective monochrome are great.4. No lags yet. I'm yet to install any games, but after opening around 5-6 social media apps , te phone didn't show any lags.5. Display with the adaptive brightness on is a treat. No more squinting in the sun to make out whats on the screen. Also when i played videos, the clarity was brilliant. Can't wait to try the VR mode.6. Split screen feature is quite convenient, I used with Whatsapp & Chrome.Will update more after a few days of use, especially about the battery which is the main reason i bought this phone"
9408,1,Very good
9409,0,I have purchased this product before 2 weeks.🔈Speaker performance is 0 out of 5 as compared to k4 noteIt is quiet disapoainted me that it doesn't support dolby atmos .But company is saying it is dolby atmos.Camera is out of focus.totaly worst as compared to other dual cam phones.Battery back up is 1 day.Only plus is heavy speed in browsing and.hd pictures .screen quality is average.1 out of 5😢😢😢Do not buy this model.better u go for k4 or k3

I am using Lenovo 1st tym hope this issue will get resolved otherwise I will never recommend this brand to anyone,..very upset"
9415,0,Good but one only speaker workingBut now all other phones better it.
9416,1,I liked the product and.it is delivered on time..
9417,0,"This product not good,why means over heting.I want another company phone?"
9418,0,Dont buy this product
9419,0,"I don't know why some people have given 5 or 4 star rating to this crap. This phone has serious issues regarding everything. The dual camera setup is something like 'jugaad' of DSLR quality photography. I didn't find any serious performance issues as it is Mediatek,not SnapDragon. I expect nothing great from Mediatek. The biggest drawback is the screen quality. I was watching a video on youtube, suddenly I thought I should increase the resolution to check the quality of screen. Dude,it was already playing on 1080p! Screen just doesn't feels like Full HD i.e. 1080p not even close to 720p. Dolby Audio is nothing but just a fake software. VR works like charm. Fingerprint is good, responsive. Didn't find issues with call quality or WiFi reception. Build quality is strictly average due to just fine metallic body. Phone will get heated up if you play games or watch video. Backlit Navigation Bar is not there,that means during night,you will probably end us guessing the navs. Front camera is again ok,selfie flash just another light feature on image. Turbo Charging is again not so impressive. Earphone jack is not of standard size or configuration as ejecting or inserting is little hard. Overall average phone,I am waiting for the customer care call to return this phone. Hugely Disappointed!"

9436,0,"Cameras not as expected, not able to take good pics as compared to latest iPhone models. The dual mode is not much as expected, especially outdoors, it needs to be worked on. It's ok for a normal user, but quality is why people buy a camera phone, especially a photography lover like me, I give the camera, including the dual mode, a 6.5/10.Powerful performance, no doubt we can enjoy using heavy apps without any problems. 64 GB internal memory is enough for me, 8/10.Light weight body, easy to handle. Good android software. Panels should have been backlit, you have to search them in dark 😞, 7/10."
9437,1,It's nice smartphone. Smart features and awesome to uses. The camera quality is nice. Mostly battery backup is fantastic. You must purchase from Amazon. Amazon give very cheap price.

One Amazon exec. promised a reimbursement but the systems were not working for a few days. When I called back after some time they said they can't reimburse, only replace the same model. The model is faulty and I don't want it. Don't know what to do. I'm willing to buy a more expensive phone from Amazon, but they're throwing a policy which isn't mentioned when u buy. Sad and frustrated."

9497,1,Amazing product at this price. I really loved it.
9498,0,"Hi All , I am writing this review after a long time as I realised that people are missing noticing one big disadvantage of this phone.I ordered this phone on the first day of it's sale. I got it in two days. The day I got it I noticed that while you connect your phone to the charging and at the same time you keep operating the phone like watching youtube videos or surfing the Facebook or wats app then it stops charging . I mean its battery percentage does not increases or it increases by 1% in 10 mins or so.The second thing I noticed is when you connect the phone through data cable to laptop or cpu then also it does not charges or charges with very slow rate like the one I mentioned above.I then asked for replacement as I thought there might be some defect in my set.However, even the set I got after replacement had the same issue. Finally I had to go for the return and refund.I think this is a manufacturing defect which exists in all Lenovo k8 note sets.I therefore advise everyone to check this issue in their set and if it's not a major concern for you then all other aspects of the mobile are great.I hope this helps. :)"

9780,0,"I bought Lenovo k8 note to myself 2 weeks ago and I can say this without any doubt that it is the best phone in the price range of 12000 to 15000 rupees. I am so much satisfied with the performance of the phone in every aspect. The performance has been very good. The best thing about the phone is its camera function and the quality of screen along with dolby atmos surround sound.The look and design of the phone is however little average in comparison to other phones of sam price range. The look and design is very outdated. But it still seems decent.The biggest USP of the phone has been its features. It has 3GB Ram with 32GB internal memory. It has a dolby atmos surround sound with 3.5 mm jack. The screen quality is also very good. It is available for a price of rupees 13000. The model with 4 GB RAM and 64GB internal memory is available for 14000 rupees.The sound quality has been excellent. In fact, Lenovo provides best sound quality in comparison to other phones.The phone give the feeling of a good value phone with some great features and nice looking body.It is a very user-friendly phone according to me.I would definitely recommend this phone everyone who are in search of a very good phone with great features in the price range of under 15000 rupees. I will rate this phone 4.5 out of 5 stars.It is definitely worth the value for money."

Which was very disappointing for me because I was one of the customers who showed interest in your product but after sometime you decreased the price. it seems like you don't give importance to the customers who have faith on you. I hope you got my point and explain me the reason behind this. And also come with a solution of this problem.As well as it's having scratch on its screen, since it is gorilla glass, not expected so early ..Thankyou "

9813,0,"The phone is very good in terms of Hardware and configuration, however, that on Software part I didn't find Andoird Nougat that good. It is lacking many features which its prior version Lenovo K4 Note was having.Many essential features like Gallery, Phone Recording etc. are missing. Also, the screen has curved edges so I am not able to find a proper tempered glass till date. This phone is actually a Motorola selling under the brand of Lenovo. Lenovo product K4 Note was much better."

Though under warranty, their service centre is unwilling to replace it with a new one by giving various excuses like insisting for phone also to be returned back along with the charger. The phone is working fine only adopter needs to be replaced, then why are they insisting for phone I don't understand. With normal charger it takes ages to fully charge."

With a microphone problem, I got it replaced. But I am not satisfied with the Options in the phone, viz. No Screen shot facility, No cast screen, camera lighting is not good, no call recording, no gallery which is a default in all other phones. if these options are reviewed and updated by Lenevo group, this phone is best. Or otherwise I may be grateful if my phone is exchanged. I bought this through Amazon. I am still having my Lenevo A 7000, I am thinking to use that as if this is not updated with the above options. Hope Lenevo will look after this to have more buyers in future as I think Lenevo is good in it's price and performance."

9931,0,"Don't waste money buying this, Lenovo K8 Note 13 mpxl camera doesn't even give you Redmi 5 mpxl camera quality and night photos are really bad. Heating is another issue, when you play games or record a video it gets heat. Also the battery is not that great, turbo charging takes about 1.5hrs to charge and it drains fast. My suggestion go for other brands which has a Sony low light enhancer (sensor) if you are looking for a camera phone.And this product you cant return and you have to go with it once you buy it. Think before you buy."
